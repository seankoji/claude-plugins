# AGENTS.md — maintainer guide for claude-plugins

This file is loaded by AI agent runtimes for sessions **inside this repo** — Claude Code
also reads its own `CLAUDE.md`, which carries the identical shared block below. This
file is for **marketplace maintainers**. Plugin *users* never see it.

**Agy caveat — read before relying on this file for Agy sessions.** Agy does not
auto-load `AGENTS.md` (or any `GEMINI.md`) from the working directory, not even inside a
registered `trustedWorkspaces` entry — it only loads either file when the session is
started with an explicit `--add-dir <path>`. Measured twice (bare cwd and the exact
registered workspace path) in `docs/platform-matrix.md`, section
`## PR 2 re-verification`, token `AGY_REGISTERED_AUTOLOAD: neither`. Consequently this
repo does **not** ship a `GEMINI.md` — it would do nothing for an ordinary
(non-`--add-dir`) Agy invocation and would just be one more file to keep in sync with
this one. Do not re-add one on the assumption cwd auto-load will pick it up.

Default branch: `master`.

## Layout

```
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # lists every plugin in plugins/
plugins/<name>/
  .claude-plugin/plugin.json      # this plugin's manifest
  commands/<name>.md              # the slash-command (its frontmatter is the source of truth)
  agents/<name>.md                # optional: subagent types this plugin registers on install
  scripts/*.sh                    # helpers; must be chmod +x
  README.md                       # user-facing docs for this plugin
build/                            # cross-platform generator: platform-table, per-plugin overrides, npm channel source
dist/                             # generated OpenCode/Agy output — committed, never hand-edited
docs/MAINTAINING.md               # extended maintainer prose (generator, install paths, versioning)
README.md                         # marketplace overview + install table (one row per plugin)

## Add-a-plugin checklist

These five things must change **together** — missing one breaks the marketplace:

1. `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` — fill every required field
2. `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` — add an entry under `"plugins"`
3. Root `README.md` "Available plugins" table — add one row
4. `plugins/<name>/README.md` — user-facing prerequisites, modes, env vars, license
5. `chmod +x plugins/<name>/scripts/*.sh` — every shipped helper must be executable

## Invariants

- **No machine paths.** Bundled scripts resolve themselves via `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`
  on Claude Code. The pattern is already established in `goldfish-judge.sh` and
  `elephant.md` — match it. Cross-platform generated artifacts (`dist/`) carry a literal
  `__PLUGIN_ROOT__` placeholder instead, resolved by the installer at install time on
  the user's machine only — never write an absolute path into the repo or into `dist/`.
  See `docs/MAINTAINING.md` for the generator/installer split.
- **Executable files are the source of truth.** `commands/*.md` owns mechanics;
  `scripts/*.sh` owns runtime behavior. READMEs *describe* them — don't restate or drift.
- **Fail-closed beats fail-open** everywhere safety-relevant. See `goldfish-judge.sh` for
  the pattern. Deliberate exception: `audit-log.sh` is telemetry, not a gate — it fails
  *soft* (warns on stderr, exits 0) on a missing `jq` or an unwritable log dir, so a
  logging hiccup never breaks the caller's primary command. Malformed *arguments* to it
  still exit 1 — those are bugs in the calling command, not the environment.

## Cross-plugin audit log

Self-improving commands (imps, prompt-builder, claude-tuneup) each append one line to a
shared, append-only `~/.claude/audit.jsonl` after a run, in addition to their own
free-text learnings log. One fixed shape across plugins is what makes a future
cross-plugin meta-command (e.g. "which command types are failing most this month")
possible at all — schema adapted from maestro's `audit.jsonl`
(github.com/sharpdeveye/maestro):

```json
{"id":"a-974bcc15","ts":"2026-07-09T02:15:37Z","plugin":"imps","command":"/imps:imps","scope":"project","project":"claude-plugins","exit_status":"completed","duration_ms":812345,"cost_estimate_usd":null,"tier":null,"attempts":null,"notes":"Shipped audit-log JSONL schema across imps, prompt-builder, claude-tuneup"}
```

`exit_status` is one of `completed | partial | blocked | failed | cancelled`. `notes` is
free text, truncated to 200 chars by the script. `cost_estimate_usd` is reserved for
future token-cost instrumentation — always `null` today. `tier` and `attempts` are
optional, `null` unless the caller passes `--tier`/`--attempts` — reserved for a future
offload-tier harness to record which tier ran a task and how many attempts it took; no
current caller sets them.

The appender is `scripts/audit-log.sh`, bundled **identically into every plugin that
uses it** (each plugin under `plugins/*/scripts/audit-log.sh`) rather than pulled
from one shared location — plugins in this marketplace install independently, so there
is no cross-plugin runtime path to require a shared lib from. `tests/run.sh` diffs the
copies against each other; if you change the script, change every copy and let the
diff check catch drift.

The free-text logs (`learnings.md`, `claude-tuneup.notes.md`) are not being replaced —
they hold qualitative "Active rules" narratives a single JSON line can't express well.
`audit.jsonl` is additive: a queryable event stream layered on top.

## Cross-platform distribution

Claude sources under `plugins/*/commands/`, `plugins/*/agents/`, `plugins/*/scripts/`
drive Claude Code behavior directly and also feed `build/generate.py`, which derives the
OpenCode and Agy artifacts under `dist/` from those sources plus
`build/platform-table.json` and `build/overrides/<plugin>/`. Editing them is normal
plugin development — Claude behavior is not frozen forever, only within a given
generator run — but any change to them needs a matching `dist/` regeneration
(`python3 build/generate.py`) committed alongside it, in a dedicated regeneration
change: never hand-edit anything under `dist/` directly, and never regenerate-and-commit
outside that dedicated change. `build/dist-lint.sh`'s `regen-diff` check is what CI
enforces on every push/PR to catch drift between sources and `dist/`; its separate
`--check-frozen-sources` flag is an opt-in, point-in-time check (diffs against
`origin/master`) for verifying one specific change left Claude sources untouched — it is
not, and must never become, a standing CI gate, since `origin/master` moves with every
merge and would eventually reject any legitimate future edit to a command/agent/script
file. Full generator, install-path, and versioning detail lives in
`docs/MAINTAINING.md`.

## Validate before committing

CI runs these checks automatically on every push and PR. For a quick local pre-commit check:
```bash
jq . .claude-plugin/marketplace.json && for f in plugins/*/.claude-plugin/plugin.json; do jq -e '.name' "$f"; done
grep -rn --include="*.md" 'CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT' plugins/*/commands/ | head  # confirm rewrites landed
```
See `.github/workflows/validate.yml` for the full check suite; `build/dist-lint.sh`
gates generated `dist/` output separately, including a self-test that the shared block
above stays identical between this file and `CLAUDE.md`.

A push to a holding/integration branch also triggers `version-bump.yml` (a bot commit
that bumps `plugin.json` versions) and re-runs `validate.yml` against that new commit —
a CI-monitor "failed" event can therefore fire while the real run is still `in_progress`
on the bumped commit. Poll `gh run view --json status,conclusion` (or the equivalent
GitHub API call) to completion before treating a failure notification as real or
dispatching a fixer.

A subagent's own sandboxed worktree can fail `git checkout`/`git commit` with an EPERM
on provenance-attributed files even though the identical command succeeds in a normal
orchestrator shell on the same tree. If this happens, run the gate commands from the
orchestrator instead, in a fresh worktree created with `git worktree add <absolute path
under $TMPDIR> origin/<branch>` — use an absolute path, since `$TMPDIR` resolves
differently between a sandboxed subagent's Bash calls and the orchestrator's own.
