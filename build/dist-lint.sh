# dist-lint.sh — the only mechanical gate on generated output (dist/).
#
# Contract: docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md, item 9. The reviewer diff and the
# persona panel both exclude `dist/` (imps-run.workflow.js hardcodes
# `git diff … -- ':!*lock*' ':!dist'`), so nothing else in this repo's review path ever
# looks at what generate.py produced. This script is the substitute: it re-asserts every
# invariant build/generate.py is supposed to guarantee, independently, against the
# committed tree — plus three invariants ("out-of-prefix uninstall path", "frozen Claude
# sources", "README marker vs. generation-manifest agreement") that get NO enforcement
# anywhere else in this run. "frozen Claude sources" is opt-in (--check-frozen-sources),
# not part of the default lint CI runs on every push/PR — see that flag's --help text.
#
# Usage:
#   build/dist-lint.sh                 # lint the whole committed dist/ + repo state
#   build/dist-lint.sh --scope <name>  # lint one plugin's slice of dist/ (+ its README)
#   build/dist-lint.sh --self-test     # prove each invariant fails on a broken fixture
#                                       # and passes on a correct one (no repo mutation)
#
# The README-marker check only fails a README that HAS a `<!-- PLATFORM-SUPPORT: -->`
# marker and disagrees with build/generation-manifest.json. A missing marker is not this
# script's failure (that's a separate acceptance item, owned by whichever task adds the
# markers) — see check_readme_marker below. The out-of-prefix-uninstall-path check is
# equally lenient when no uninstaller script exists yet in this worktree: with nothing to
# scan, there is nothing to fail. Both are exercised for real by --self-test regardless of
# what does or doesn't exist in the working tree, via synthetic fixtures under mktemp.

                            unrelated change to a command/agent/script file. Use it once,
                            e.g. right before merging a change that must prove it left
                            Claude sources untouched.
  --self-test              prove each of the 10 invariants below fails on a broken fixture

# A script only gets scanned if it actually contains an `rm -f`/`rm -rf` call — a script
# with nothing to remove has nothing for this invariant to enforce, so real-repo scanning
