"""Generate OpenCode and Antigravity (agy) artifacts from the frozen Claude sources.

Contract: docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md. Every platform behaviour this relies on is
cited in build/platform-table.json's per-platform `evidence` block, which points at
docs/platform-matrix.md. Nothing here measures a platform; facts come from the matrix or
they do not get used.

Determinism contract (verbatim from the plan):
  * every filesystem enumeration is wrapped in sorted()
  * JSON is dumped with sort_keys=True, indent=2, ensure_ascii=False plus a trailing "\\n"
  * every file is opened with newline="\\n"
  * no timestamps, hostnames, absolute paths, os.environ reads, or dict ordering derived
    from **kwargs
