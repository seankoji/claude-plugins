#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Behavioral test harness for plugins/*/scripts/*.sh — runs fixtures against
# the real scripts and diffs actual output against golden files. Static
# manifest/schema checks live in .github/workflows/validate.yml; this covers
# what those can't: does the script actually do the right thing when run.
#
# Two fixture kinds, each a leaf directory under tests/fixtures/:
#
#   exec/<plugin>/<script>/<case>/
#     Runs the real script end-to-end with external commands (gh, git)
#     replaced by tests/lib/stubs/* on PATH, from a fresh empty $PWD.
#       args             one CLI arg per line (optional)
#       stdout           exact expected stdout (optional)
#       stdout.contains  one grep -E pattern per line, each must match
#                        somewhere in actual stdout — use instead of `stdout`
#                        when the real output has non-deterministic parts
#                        (e.g. `ls -la` timestamps) (optional)
#       stderr           exact expected stderr (optional)
#       exit_code        expected exit code, default 0 (optional)
#       files/           optional dir; its contents are copied into the case's
#                        fresh $PWD before the script runs — for scripts that
#                        require an input file on disk (e.g. goldfish-judge.sh's
#                        DOC argument) that the empty-PWD harness can't otherwise
#                        supply. Exec fixtures have no mechanism to set env vars,
#                        so a stub that needs to vary its behavior per fixture
#                        must derive its mode from argv/PWD content instead (see
#                        tests/lib/stubs/gemini's header comment).
#
#   unit/<plugin>/<script>/<function>/<case>/
#     Sources the script with __SOURCED__=1 (see the guard comment in
#     goldfish-judge.sh — this stops execution before the script's "do the
#     thing" tail) and calls one function directly.
#       arg      passed as "$1" to the function (mutually exclusive w/ stdin)
#       stdin    piped to the function's stdin (mutually exclusive w/ arg)
#       expected exact expected stdout
#
#     The <function> path segment IS the call site: run_unit_case below calls
#     "$func" dynamically, derived from this directory name, not from a static
#     reference anywhere in source. A grep for a function name that finds only
#     its definition does NOT prove it's dead code — check for a matching
#     tests/fixtures/unit/<plugin>/<script>/<function>/ dir first. Deleting a
#     function whose only caller is a fixture dir here silently deletes its
#     only test coverage too (a real incident: #174 deleted a fail-closed
#     gate's sole unit coverage this way, past a scout and an implementer,
#     caught only by adversarial panel review).
