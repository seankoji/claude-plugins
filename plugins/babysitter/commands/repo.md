# /babysitter:repo — keep one repository's PRs unblocked

**Before executing any steps**, output this intro block:

> 🍼 **babysitter:repo** — babysitting every open PR in one repo
>
> Clearing what blocks each open pull request here — review comments, merge conflicts,
> failing checks, drift behind the base branch — then watching the repository so new
> pull requests and new events are picked up as they land. Fix commits are reviewed
> locally before they are pushed. Nothing is pushed until you approve the roster.

`/babysitter:org` with the blast radius of one repository. Same sweep, same agents, same
watch — the only difference is the scope of the query and the fact that you are almost
always in the repository you are asking about.

**It keeps watching after the sweep, including for pull requests that do not exist yet.**
A PR opened while the watch is running shows up as a `NEW` event on the next poll and
gets the same treatment as the ones that were there at the start. This is the reason the
watch does **not** pass `--exit-when-empty`: a repository with no open PRs right now is a
quiet repository, not a finished one.

**Push scope.** Fix commits go to PR head branches in this repository only, never to a
base or default branch, never force-pushed. The roster gate is where you approve that.

## Status table

End every turn — the roster gate, the end of a dispatch round, each batch of events
handled in the watch — with a table covering every PR currently on the roster. Drop a
PR entirely the turn it merges or closes rather than keeping a row for it:

| PR | mergeStateStatus | Blocker |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `#123` | `CLEAN` \| `BEHIND` \| `BLOCKED` \| `DIRTY` \| `DRAFT` \| `UNSTABLE` \| `UNKNOWN` | `—` \| one line naming the actual cause |

`mergeStateStatus` is GitHub's own live state (`list-prs.sh`'s `merge_state_status`, or
`merge-pr.sh`'s fresher read right after acting), not this run's tracking, so a merged
PR is simply absent — nothing to update by hand. `CLEAN` needs no `Blocker` entry;
everything else names the actual cause (`merge-pr.sh`'s `reason=`/`detail=`, or "N
unresolved review threads" / "failing check: `<name>`" from a raw snapshot), and if
`automerge=armed` was reported, say so in the same cell — that is the difference
between "still needs a push" and "will finish on its own."

Refresh a row from whatever just fired for that PR rather than re-running
`list-prs.sh` for the whole table every time.

---

## Step 0 — Load what previous runs learned

Read `~/.claude/babysitter/learnings.md` if it exists — `$BABYSITTER_HOME/learnings.md`
when that variable is set. `Read` is a tool call, not Bash: it does not expand `~`, so
resolve `$HOME` yourself and pass the absolute path.

Apply the `## Active rules` section to the whole run, and the `## Per-repo notes` line
for this repository — passing it into the agent prompt in Step 5, since agents
cannot read this file. Apply both silently; a missing file is the normal first run.

The file sits outside every repository being babysat on purpose. What this command
learns is about the machine, the remote, and the runbook — none of which belong in the
repository whose PRs it is fixing.

## Taking notes while it runs

Same mechanism and the same five kinds as `/babysitter:org` (*Taking notes while the
sweep runs*), with this command's own name:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/run-note.sh \
  --command /babysitter:repo --kind <env|github|process|repo|policy> \
  --scope "<owner/repo, or owner/repo#N>" --note "<what happened, and what to do about it>"
```

Notes land in `~/.claude/babysitter/run-notes/<date>-babysitter-repo.md`. Write one when the
machine, the remote, this runbook, this repository, or a gate did something a future run
would want to know about. Routine progress is not a note.

## Step 1 — Preflight and resolve the repository

```bash
command -v gh >/dev/null && command -v jq >/dev/null && gh auth status
```

Stop and say which is missing if any of the three fails.

Resolve the repository, in this order:

1. `$1`, if the invocation passed one. Accept `owner/name` or a full GitHub URL.
2. Otherwise the current repository: `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner`
3. Otherwise stop and ask. Do not guess.

Say which repository you resolved before going further — "the current repo" is exactly
the assumption worth stating out loud when the next step pushes commits.

## Step 2 — Enumerate

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/list-prs.sh --repo <owner/repo> [passthrough flags]
```

Forward `--include-drafts`, `--include-forks` and `--all-authors` if the user passed
them. Defaults are the same as `/babysitter:org`: open PRs authored by you or a bot,
excluding drafts and PRs whose head branch lives in a fork.

`--all-authors` is worth offering here more often than in org mode — a single repository
is a plausible thing to babysit on a team's behalf, where an org-wide sweep of everyone's
branches is not. Offer it; do not assume it.

One JSON object per line. Exit 3 means the query failed: report it and stop. A warning on
stderr about a truncated result means the repository has more open PRs than `--limit`
fetched — raise it (max 100) rather than proceeding with a partial roster.

Zero lines is not a reason to stop here, unlike in org mode: ask whether to watch the
repository anyway for PRs opened later. If the user says no, stop.

## Step 3 — Roster gate

Print one row per PR — number, author, title, and its blockers, from the snapshot:

| field in the snapshot | blocker shown |
| --- | --- |
| `mergeable == "CONFLICTING"` | conflict |
| `failing` non-empty | checks: names |
| `unresolved_threads > 0` | comments: N |

Base drift is deliberately **not** on this list. `base_oid` is the base branch head
itself, so no comparison against it is possible from a snapshot alone — telling whether
this PR already contains those commits needs a merge-base, which the agent computes in
its worktree for free. Every dispatched agent checks and merges base drift as its first
step, so a PR that is behind is handled whether or not the roster could see it.

A PR with none of these is `clean` — no agent is dispatched for it, but it is not left
untouched: Step 3.5 still attempts to land it immediately.

Ask for confirmation, naming how many PRs will receive pushes and the total on the
roster (Step 3.5 runs against all of them, clean ones included). Wait for a clear yes.
If the user narrows the list, honour exactly that subset for both.

## Step 3.5 — Merge or arm auto-merge for the whole roster

Before any worktree or agent, give every approved PR — `clean` ones included — an
immediate landing attempt:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/merge-pr.sh --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number>
```

One call per PR, same one-invocation-per-call discipline as `pr-workspace.sh` below.

`MERGED ...` — done. Drop it from the roster entirely — no worktree, no dispatch.

`BLOCKED ... reason=<x> detail=<y> automerge=armed` — still blocked on `<x>` (handled
normally from Step 4 onward if it needs a push), but GitHub will merge it the moment
`<x>` clears on its own, with no further call to this script needed.

`BLOCKED ... automerge=unavailable` — either this repository has auto-merge turned off
in its settings, or arming it failed for a GitHub-side reason. Treat `reason=`/`detail=`
exactly as Step 4 onward already does; this only means the eventual unblock will need
an explicit merge afterward instead of happening on its own. A repository with
auto-merge off is the owner's choice, not a workaround to look for.

## Step 4 — Prepare worktrees

For each approved PR, **in the orchestrator, one at a time**:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-workspace.sh --repo <owner/repo> --pr <number> --branch <head_ref>
```

The path is the last line of stdout.

Serial matters more here than anywhere else: every PR in this command shares one cache
clone, and two concurrent `git worktree add` calls on one clone corrupt its index. The
first PR pays for the clone; the rest are fast.

**One `pr-workspace.sh` call per Bash tool invocation**, and dispatch each PR's agent
(Step 5) as soon as *its* worktree is ready rather than waiting for the whole roster.
Two reasons, both learned the hard way: a `while read` loop running many of these inside
one Bash call has been seen failing from the second iteration on with `command not
found` on plain coreutils; and finishing all setup before any dispatch leaves every
agent slot idle behind the slowest clone. Only the `pr-workspace.sh` calls need to be
serial — separate worktrees cut from one clone are safe to work in concurrently.

Exit 4 means a previous run left uncommitted changes in that worktree — report the path
and skip that PR rather than resetting over the work.

**Do not pass `isolation: "worktree"` to the Agent tool.** Even when this repository *is*
the session's repository, that would isolate the session's own checkout rather than the
per-PR worktree the path above names, and two PRs would end up sharing one.

## Step 5 — Dispatch

One `babysitter:🍼` agent per PR, `model: "haiku"`, concurrently, at most 8 in flight.

**The agent owns its PR end-to-end — blockers, push, and the merge itself (its contract's
step 5).** This orchestrator's only `merge-pr.sh` touch is the Step 3.5 landing pass up
front; after dispatch it never edits a PR's branch, never polls its checks, never retries
a merge — fan-out ends when a PR is merged or comes back definitively blocked. If per-PR
work keeps landing back here, that is a prompt gap — the fix is a better dispatch, not
doing the work in this context.

Each prompt carries the worktree path, `repo`, `number`, `url`, `head_ref`, `base_ref`,
the failing check names, and the unresolved review threads:

```bash
gh api "repos/<owner/repo>/pulls/<number>/comments" \
  --jq '[.[] | select((.body | startswith("[babysitter]")) | not)
        | {id, user: .user.login, path, line, body}]'
```

The `[babysitter]` filter drops the plugin's own replies; without it an agent answers
itself on the next pass.

## Step 6 — Deal with what came back blocked

**First, read what it was blocked on — a stronger model does not fix every blocker.**

If `blocked_on` is about pushing or the environment rather than the code — an auth or
signing failure, a network or proxy error, a gate that could not run — escalating burns
a sonnet dispatch to rediscover the same wall. The agent's work is already committed in
its worktree; the cheaper move is to finish it yourself:

```bash
git -C <worktree> push origin HEAD:<head_ref>
```

The orchestrator has options a dispatched agent does not (a sandbox bypass among them),
and in one sweep this cleared three of three push failures that had presented as three
different errors, on the first retry, with no code change. If the retry also fails, then
report it — do not escalate a wall to a bigger model.

For a blocker in the code or the judgment — a design decision, an ambiguous review
comment, two incompatible sides of a conflict — re-dispatch **that PR once** at
`model: "sonnet"`, passing `blocked_on` and `notes` through verbatim.

Once. Then report rather than retrying:
`⚠ <repo>#<number> still blocked after escalation: <reason>`

## Step 6.5 — The agent already merged it

The dispatched agent drives its PR through `merge-pr.sh` itself (its contract's step 5)
and returns the outcome — this orchestrator never runs the merge. Handle what came back:

| agent `status` | what it means | what to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `merged` | `merge-pr.sh` reported `MERGED` | drop it from the roster; remove the worktree now if you like rather than waiting for `GONE` |
| `done` | blockers cleared; `merge.result` says how the merge attempt went | if `merge.automerge_armed` is `true`, GitHub lands it on its own — watch and report; otherwise re-dispatch once so the agent completes the merge (contract step 5) |
| `blocked`, `blocked_on` starting `merge:` | the merge was refused on live state | map to a Step 8 event below — an event, not a retry target |
| `partial` / `blocked` on code or judgment | cleared some blockers; needs a human or a stronger model | Step 6's escalation rules |

`merge:` reasons map to Step 8 events exactly:

- `merge:unanswered_threads` — a thread nobody actually answered; treat as a `THREADS` event.
- `merge:branch_protection` — outside this plugin's authority: a required human reviewer,
  a code-scanning alert at or above the org's threshold, a ruleset requiring approval from
  someone other than the author. **Never chase this with `--admin` or any other override** —
  report it by number and move on.
- `merge:conflict` — stale state; treat as a fresh `CONFLICT` event.
- `merge:failing_checks` — a required check went red; treat as a fresh `CHECKS-FAILED` event.

There is no orchestrator-side `merge-pr.sh` in this command. A merge that needs a retry
is a re-dispatch (Step 8), never a call from here.

## Step 7 — Arm the watch

```
Monitor:
  command: ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/pr-events.sh --repo <owner/repo> --interval <interval> [passthrough flags]
  description: "<owner/repo> — open PRs: new, conflicts, checks, reviews, base drift"
  persistent: true
```

Pass the same passthrough flags as Step 2 so the watch and the sweep agree on scope. No
`--exit-when-empty` — this watch is meant to outlive the current set of PRs. Default
interval 60s; the script refuses anything below 30s.

Say that the watch is armed, that it will pick up newly opened PRs, and that `/tasks` or
TaskStop ends it.

## Step 8 — Handle events

Each line is `<KIND> <repo>#<number> [detail] [url]`.

| kind | what to do |
| --- | --- |
| `NEW` | a PR was opened (or became eligible) — Step 4 then Step 5 for it |
| `CONFLICT`, `BASE-MOVED` | re-dispatch that PR, blocker = conflict / base moved (the agent checks whether it is actually behind) |
| `CHECKS-FAILED` | re-dispatch, blocker = the named checks |
| `REVIEW`, `COMMENT`, `THREADS` | re-fetch that PR's comments (Step 5) and re-dispatch |
| `CHECKS-GREEN` | if this PR has been dispatched at least once this run and has no agent in flight, re-dispatch it so its agent can run the merge (contract step 5); an agent already in flight will see the green and merge itself — fold, don't stack. A PR still `clean` from Step 3 that never needed a dispatch is unaffected — report either way |
| `DRAFT` | drop from the active roster; a draft is not ready |
| `GONE` | `pr-workspace.sh --repo <owner/repo> --pr <n> --remove`, drop from the roster |
| `ERROR` | report it; the monitor is still polling |
| `END` | the watch stopped — go to Step 9 |

`NEW` goes through the roster gate the same way the initial sweep did: name the PR and
its author and get a yes before pushing to it. The gate in Step 3 approved the PRs on the
table at that moment, not every PR the repository will ever have.

Two rules that keep this from thrashing:

- **One agent per PR at a time.** Events arriving for a PR whose agent is still running
  are noted and folded into one re-dispatch when it returns.
- **Coalesce a batch.** Several events for one PR in a single notification are one
  re-dispatch carrying all of them.

Send a PushNotification for anything worth acting on now — a PR still blocked after
escalation, a repeated `ERROR`. Routine green checks are not that.

## Step 9 — Stop

When the user stops the watch, or on `END`:

1. TaskStop the monitor if it is still running.
2. Summarize: PRs handled, pushes made, still blocked and why.
3. Leave the worktrees as a warm cache. Remove them only if asked:
   `pr-workspace.sh --repo <owner/repo> --pr <n> --remove`
4. Distil the run into `learnings.md` — see *Distilling the run into learnings* below.
5. Append one audit line:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/audit-log.sh \
  --plugin babysitter --command /babysitter:repo --scope project \
  --exit-status <completed|partial|blocked|failed|cancelled> \
  --duration-ms <ms since the sweep started> \
  --notes "<owner/repo>: <n> PRs, <p> pushed, <b> still blocked"
```

Scope is `project` here, unlike `/babysitter:org` — this run really does belong to one
repository.

## Distilling the run into learnings

Exactly as in `/babysitter:org` (*Distilling the run into learnings*): read today's
ledger under `~/.claude/babysitter/run-notes/` plus the `learnings` array from every
agent that returned one, append a `## Run log` entry to
`~/.claude/babysitter/learnings.md` headed
`### <YYYY-MM-DD> — /babysitter:repo <owner/repo>`, promote anything now seen twice into
`## Active rules` (cap 10), fold `repo`-kind notes into `## Per-repo notes`, and report
it in one line. No confirmation gate.
