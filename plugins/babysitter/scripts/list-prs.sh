# list-prs.sh — emit a full state snapshot, one compact JSON object per line, for
# every open pull request the babysitter is allowed to touch.
#
# This is the plugin's ONLY GitHub reader. Both the initial sweep and the event
# monitor call it: the sweep uses the identity fields, pr-events.sh polls it on an
# interval and diffs consecutive snapshots to derive events. One reader means the
# eligibility rules can never disagree between "which PRs we picked up" and "which
# PRs we react to".
#
# Everything comes from a single GraphQL call per invocation — mergeability, base
# head, check rollup, review threads and the newest comment/review ids — so a poll
# loop over dozens of PRs costs one request, not one per PR per field.
#
# The GraphQL round trip itself goes over curl, not `gh api graphql`. Under the
# Claude Code sandbox's network filter, gh's Go TLS stack fails cert verification
# for this endpoint (x509 errors) while curl completes the same handshake cleanly —
# observed consistently enough to be a real routing difference, not a flake. `gh`
# is still required, but only for `gh auth token`, a local credential read with no
# network round trip of its own.
#
# Usage:
#   list-prs.sh --org <org> [options]            # every eligible open PR in the org
#   list-prs.sh --repo <owner/name> [options]    # every eligible open PR in one repo
#   list-prs.sh --repo <owner/name> --pr <N>     # one specific PR
#
# Options:
#   --include-drafts   keep draft PRs (default: skipped — a draft is not ready)
#   --include-forks    keep PRs whose head branch lives in a fork (default: skipped;
#                      we usually cannot push to a fork's branch)
#   --all-authors      keep PRs by anyone (default: only the authenticated user and bots)
#   --limit <N>        max PRs to return in --org / --repo sweep mode (default 100,
#                      GitHub caps a search page at 100 and this does not paginate;
#                      a truncated result warns on stderr)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — snapshot written to stdout (possibly zero lines)
#   2 — precondition failed (missing gh/jq, not authenticated, bad arguments)
#   3 — the GitHub query itself failed (network, rate limit, permissions)
#
# Exit 3 is kept distinct from 2 on purpose: a poll loop should retry a failed
# query but must never retry a bad argument.

# Runs a GraphQL query, retrying a failed one twice with a widening pause.
#
# An org-wide sweep asks GitHub for every open PR across every repository in one
# query, which sits close enough to GitHub's response-time budget that a 504 ("we
# couldn't respond to your request in time") on the first attempt is ordinary rather
# than exceptional — observed twice in a row on a ~40-PR org, then succeeding on the
# third try with no change. Retrying here rather than in the caller matters because
# pr-events.sh polls through this script: without it, one transient 504 surfaces as an
# ERROR event in the middle of a watch that was otherwise fine.
#
# Bounded at three attempts, so a genuine failure (bad credentials, a repo that is
# gone) still exits 3 promptly instead of hanging a sweep behind a retry loop.
# Overridable so the test suite does not spend six real seconds asleep proving that a
# permanently-failing query still exits 3. Nothing in normal use sets it.
#
# Validated rather than interpolated straight into the arithmetic below: this variable
# exists to be overridden, and a non-integer value there is not a harmless typo. Under
# `set -e` a fractional value aborts the script with "invalid arithmetic operator", and
# under `set -u` an alphabetic one aborts with "unbound variable" — either way the sweep
# dies mid-retry with no snapshot and the wrong exit code, instead of retrying. Fall
# back to the default and say so.
