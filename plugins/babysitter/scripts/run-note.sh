# run-note.sh — append one observation to this run's live notes ledger.
#
# A `/babysitter:org` sweep can run for hours across dozens of repositories, and the
# things worth learning from it (a credential helper that fails headlessly, a repo whose
# clone is SSH-only, a gate that failed open) are discovered mid-run and forgotten by the
# summary. This writes each one down as it happens, outside every repository being
# babysat, so the run's notes survive a crash, a /compact, or a stopped watch.
#
# The ledger is raw and append-only. The command's stop step distils it into the durable
# `learnings.md` alongside it; nothing reads this file automatically.
#
# Usage:
#   run-note.sh --command <slash-command> --kind <kind> --note <text> [--scope <label>]
#
#   kind:  env | github | process | repo | policy
#     env      the machine or sandbox — credentials, TLS, PATH, permissions
#     github   the API or a remote — 504s, rate limits, stalled clones
#     process  this command's own runbook — ordering, batching, dispatch shape
#     repo     a fact about one repository that will still be true next run
#     policy   a gate or safety rule that failed, fired wrongly, or was bypassed
#   scope: free label for what the note is about — an org, `owner/repo`, `owner/repo#N`
#
# Prints the ledger path on stdout.
#
# Best-effort by design, exactly like audit-log.sh: an unwritable notes directory warns
# on stderr and exits 0 rather than breaking a sweep that is otherwise going fine — this
# is a notebook, not a gate. Malformed arguments still exit 1; those are bugs in the
# calling command, not the environment.
set -uo pipefail

# Kept above the arg loop so the unit test harness (which sources this script with
# __SOURCED__=1 and calls one function directly) can exercise it without going through
# argv parsing — same arrangement as audit-log.sh's json helpers.
#
# /babysitter:org -> babysitter-org, so the ledger name is a usable filename on any
# platform and one command's notes never land in another's file. Collapsing runs of
# separators rather than mapping each one keeps `/babysitter::org` from becoming
# `babysitter--org` and splitting a command's notes across two files on a typo.
