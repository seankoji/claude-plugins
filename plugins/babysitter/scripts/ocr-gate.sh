# ocr-gate.sh — review the babysitter's own work before it is pushed.
#
# Every fix this plugin makes lands on someone's open PR, where a bad change costs a
# whole extra review round-trip. Running a review over the diff first turns that
# round-trip into a local loop: the agent reads the findings, fixes them, and pushes
# once.
#
# Tool selection, in order:
#   0. codex adversarial-review — tried first when the Codex plugin is installed and
#      usable. A completed verdict (approve or needs-attention) is authoritative and
#      is reported immediately; anything else (not installed, crashed, timed out, no
#      usable verdict) falls through to the chain below without comment — Codex is a
#      best-effort first opinion, not a required one.
#   1. ocr-pre-pr.sh — the user's own wrapper, if installed. Preferred because it
#      writes the HEAD-keyed cache entry their before-PR gate reads, so a babysitter
#      push and a hand-made push are gated by the same record.
#   2. ocr review — the upstream CLI, invoked directly.
#   3. ocr delegate — fallback when either of the above could not reach its LLM. Emits
#      a review spec instead of a review; the calling agent performs the review itself.
#   4. neither    — reports status=skipped and exits 0.
#
# Case 4 is deliberately fail-soft, which is the opposite of this repo's usual
# fail-closed rule, and the reason is the same one that exempts audit-log.sh: `ocr`
# (and now Codex) are optional third-party tools, not bundled dependencies. Hard-failing
# here would make the entire plugin unusable for anyone who has not installed them. What
# is NOT soft is the reporting — status=skipped is stated in the summary line so no agent
# can report a push as "reviewed" when nothing reviewed it.
#
# Case 3 exists because of a specific, observed failure. `ocr` talks to an LLM gateway
# over TLS, and in a sandboxed agent context that connection can fail for reasons that
# have nothing to do with the diff — a proxy whose certificate the Go TLS stack rejects
# (`x509: OSStatus -26276`) took out the gate on nearly every push of a 32-PR sweep.
# Each agent then judged the failure "infrastructure, not a code issue" and pushed
# unreviewed, which is exactly the judgment call a mandated gate exists not to depend
# on. `ocr delegate` needs no LLM at all, so it survives that failure and turns a
# skipped review into one the agent performs itself.
#
# Run this from inside the PR worktree.
#
# Usage:
#   ocr-gate.sh --base <base-ref> [--out <result.json>]
#
# Prints one summary line to stdout:
#   OCR status=<clean|findings|delegate|skipped|error> findings=<n> result=<path|-> tool=<name>
#
# Exit codes (0/1/2 match ocr-pre-pr.sh so the two are interchangeable to a caller):
#   0 — clean, or skipped because ocr is not installed
#   1 — the review produced findings; address them before pushing
#   2 — the review could not run and could not be delegated either
#   3 — the review could not run, but result= holds a delegation spec: review it
#       yourself before pushing. Not a licence to push unreviewed.
