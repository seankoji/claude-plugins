#!/usr/bin/env bash
#
# merge-pr.sh — attempt to actually land one pull request, fixing exactly the
# merge-blockers that are safe to fix without a human's judgment.
#
# Reads current PR state, updates a behind branch, and pins each merge request to
# the checked head SHA. Review threads must already be explicitly resolved after
# verification. A comment prefix cannot prove that a finding was addressed.
# Incomplete snapshots and changed heads stop without arming auto-merge.
#
# Every network call goes over curl, not `gh api` / `gh pr merge` — same reason as
# list-prs.sh (see its header): under the Claude Code sandbox, gh's Go TLS stack
# fails cert verification against api.github.com while curl completes the identical
# handshake cleanly. `gh` is used only for `gh auth token`, a local credential read.
#
# Usage:
#   merge-pr.sh --repo <owner/name> --pr <N> [--method squash|merge|rebase] [--no-auto]
#   merge-pr.sh --repo <owner/name> --pr <N> --resolve-thread <ID> --verified-head <SHA>
#
# The resolution mode is a separate, explicit action after the agent verifies the
# finding and posts its evidence. It checks thread ownership and the verified head,
# resolves that one thread, and exits without attempting a merge or auto-merge.
#
# Without --method, tries squash, then merge, then rebase, stopping at the first the
# repository accepts — GitHub's own error names any method the repo disallows, which
# is simpler and more current than caching each repo's `allowed_merge_methods` here.
#
# Eligible BLOCKED outcomes also try arming GitHub's native auto-merge before it
# reports — the courtesy costs one extra mutation and means a PR blocked only on
# something outside this script's authority (a pending required check, a review
# still needed) finishes on its own the moment that condition clears, with no further
# call to this script needed. Arming it changes nothing about whether THIS run
# considers the PR blocked; the exit code and reason are unaffected.
#
# Exit codes:
#   0 — merged, or explicit resolution mode printed "RESOLVED <repo>#<pr> ..."
#   2 — precondition failed (missing gh/curl/jq, bad arguments)
#   3 — the GitHub query itself failed (network, rate limit, permissions)
#   4 — blocked on something this script will not act on unasked: a required human
#       approval, a code-scanning threshold, an unresolved thread with no
#       verified resolution yet, or a merge conflict. Never retried, never
#       overridden with admin/force. (stdout: "BLOCKED <repo>#<pr> reason=<category>
#       detail=<...> automerge=<armed|unavailable>")
#
# What this script will NOT do, on purpose:
#   - Never passes `--admin` to bypass branch protection. A required check, a
#     required reviewer, or an org ruleset exists on purpose; the fix for a PR that
#     cannot satisfy one is either satisfying it for real or a human's call to waive
#     it, never a flag this script reaches for on its own.
#   - Never resolves review threads as part of merging. Resolution requires the
#     separate --resolve-thread action and the agent's --verified-head assertion.
#   - Never rebases or force-pushes the PR branch itself. `--method rebase` is
#     GitHub's server-side "rebase and merge" against the *base* branch (replays the
#     PR's commits, then fast-forwards the base) — it never rewrites or force-pushes
#     the PR's own branch, so it does not conflict with the agent's "never
#     force-push" rule, which is about that branch's own history.
