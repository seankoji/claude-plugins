# elephant-goldfish

Two commands from [Rensin's article](https://drensin.medium.com/elephants-goldfish-and-the-new-golden-age-of-software-engineering-c33641a48874), covering both halves of it:

| Command | Article | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| [`/elephant-goldfish:thinking`](#elephant-goldfishthinking--think-before-building) | Part 1, steps 1–2 | Interrogates a problem, then builds a grading rubric, and emits the plan — ready to paste into a fresh session. Does not run step 3. |
| [`/elephant-goldfish:elephant`](#what-it-does) | Part 2 | Writes and cold-checks a repo's durable design document, `elephant.md`, using a different-lineage Gemini reader as the judge. |

They compose: `thinking` maps a problem before any code exists; `elephant` keeps the resulting
design honest once it does. Neither requires the other.

If you installed the `recon` plugin, it was removed from this marketplace in 0.2.0 — run
`claude plugin uninstall recon@seankoji`.

This is the proof plugin for the cross-platform generator: script-backed (judge,
state resolver, renderer) but platform-neutral, and its two `SKILL.md` files map
directly onto Agy skills. Generated output lives under `dist/opencode/` and
`dist/agy/elephant-goldfish/`; see
[`docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md`](../../docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md) and
[`docs/platform-matrix.md`](../../docs/platform-matrix.md) for how and why.

## `/elephant-goldfish:thinking` — think before building

Two guided conversations, then a document.

1. **Interrogate** (article step 1) — 15–20 minutes of adversarial questioning that hunts the
   constraints you haven't thought of, not the ones you already have. You end it, not the
   command. → `discovery.md`
2. **Build the rubric** (article step 2) — a skeptic interview framed around "you get exactly
   one shot and can't ask follow-ups", which is what forces criteria to be concrete enough for
   a stranger to grade. → `spec.md`
3. **Emit the plan** — `handoff.md`, assembled deterministically by script from the two
   documents above. → paste into a fresh session, or run the `/imps:imps` line at the top of
   it.

The plan is the output. Step 3 is deliberately not run: the author's claim is that a session
with no memory of the negotiation produces better work than the one that argued its way to the
brief, and a command that helpfully finished the job would destroy the property it spent an
hour building.

```
/elephant-goldfish:thinking          # start, or pick up an existing topic
/elephant-goldfish:thinking list     # what's in flight
```

**Output type** is chosen per topic and changes both the questions and the handoff format:
`research` (a standalone answer) or `implementation` (a plan that becomes code, handed to
`/imps:imps`).

**Storage.** Everything lands in `thinking/<topic-slug>/` — `meta.json`, `discovery.md`,
`spec.md`, `handoff.md`. Optionally each artifact is also posted, as it completes, as a comment
on one GitHub Issue or Discussion per topic, so the thread reads as the progression of the
thinking. You confirm the target once per run; nothing is published without that yes.

**Why this command pins `model: opus`** — the only one in this marketplace that does. It is
entirely judgment work, and the failure modes are specific: accepting a first answer instead
of pushing on it, asking questions whose answers you already had, softening disagreement into
"it depends", running out of angles after two rounds. A capable model is the best lever on all
four. **It's a default, not a requirement** — nothing in the pipeline depends on it, and if
Opus access is rate-limited you can delete the `model:` line from `commands/thinking.md` and
inherit the session model; the structural anti-sycophancy rules do most of the work and help
any model.

Only the conversation is pinned — mechanical recon goes to whatever cheap read-only subagent
the environment provides (a haiku `scout`, `Explore`), falling back to reading files directly.
The plugin registers no agents of its own, so there is nothing to collide with a `scout` you
already define.

### Bundled scripts

| Script | Job |
|---|---|
| `thinking_state.py` | One compact JSON per call — topic resolution, phase, artifact digests, publish status. Replaces `ls`/`cat`/`stat` round-trips that would otherwise pull whole documents into context to recover a few bytes of state. Includes a fail-closed `gate`. |
| `render_handoff.py` | Assembles `handoff.md` from `discovery.md` + `spec.md` and a template. Deterministic concatenation — the model never regenerates text that is already on disk. |
| `gh_publish.py` | Find-or-create the topic's Issue/Discussion, post artifacts as comments. Idempotent by content digest, so an unchanged file is skipped and an edited one re-posts. `--dry-run` on every mutating subcommand. |

### Cowork

The same process ships as two skills — `thinking-discover` and `thinking-spec` — which share
the `templates/` directory with the command and need no scripts. Trigger them with "help me
think through X" and "let's build the rubric".

## `/elephant-goldfish:elephant`

### What it does

> "Design is the new code." — One repo = one `elephant.md` that lets a zero-context session re-bootstrap the project without reading all the code.

The command writes or updates `elephant.md` grounded in the repo, then runs a closed
judge → patch → re-judge loop (up to 5 rounds) where the judge is a cold Gemini read via
the `gemini` CLI — a different model lineage from the Claude author, with the doc inlined
into its prompt and no other repo access. A PASS means *a real zero-context reader can
bootstrap from this doc* — see **Limitations** below for what a PASS does **not** mean.

**Invocations:**

| Invocation | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/elephant-goldfish:elephant` | Write/update `elephant.md`, then run the judge loop |
| `/elephant-goldfish:elephant check` | Read-only factual drift check (citations + structure); no writes, no judge |
| `/elephant-goldfish:elephant <failure report>` | Fold in a goldfish failure report pasted back from a prior run |

## Limitations — read before trusting a PASS

The judge measures **plausibility, not truth**. It reads only the doc, by design — repo
access would let the doc cheat its own gaps — but that same design means a confidently
wrong doc can still pass; the judge has no way to catch a claim that's fluent, specific,
and false. Use `check` mode for factual accuracy; use the judge for bootstrap-sufficiency.
The two are complementary, not interchangeable.

## Prerequisites

| | `elephant` | `thinking` |
|---|---|---|
| `gemini` CLI | **required** | not used |
| `python3` | not used | **required** (3.9+, stdlib only) |
| `gh` CLI | not used | optional — only for GitHub publishing; local-only storage needs nothing |

**For `elephant`, the `gemini` CLI must be on your PATH.**

The goldfish judge calls `gemini` for a cold, different-lineage read. If it's missing or
returns empty output, the judge fails **closed** (exit 2 — never a false pass). It will
not silently skip validation.

Do **not** point `GEMINI_MODEL` at a Claude model — that reintroduces the "clone grading
its own homework" problem.

Verify before using:

```sh
gemini --help
gemini -p "say VERDICT: READY"   # should print a VERDICT line
```

---

## Install

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add seankoji/claude-plugins
claude plugin install elephant-goldfish@seankoji
```

---

## Usage

Run from the root of any git repo:

```
/elephant-goldfish:elephant
```

The command runs interactively inside a Claude Code session. Auto / accept-edits mode is recommended — the judge loop runs Bash (the judge) and Writes the doc multiple times without prompting.

### Env vars you can override

| Var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | `gemini-2.5-pro` | Any Gemini model name accepted by `gemini` |
| `OLLAMA_MODEL` | _(unset)_ | Optional second-opinion judge via `ollama run`, run sequentially after `gemini`. Set to any model name `ollama` accepts (e.g. `qwen3:14b-q8_0`). READY requires both judges to agree. Honors `OLLAMA_HOST` for a remote instance. Do not use a Claude model. |
| `OLLAMA_NO_THINK` | `true` | Prepend `/no_think` to the Ollama prompt to suppress thinking-model preamble (qwen3, etc.) so `VERDICT:` is the first output line. Set `false` for non-thinking models that don't recognise the token. |
| `OLLAMA_HOST` | _(ollama default)_ | Override Ollama endpoint, e.g. a LAN host, for a remote instance. |
| `JUDGE_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Seconds before a hung `gemini`/`ollama` judge call is killed (needs `timeout` or `gtimeout` on PATH; otherwise unguarded) |

---

## The `goldfish-judge.sh` script

The bundled `scripts/goldfish-judge.sh` is the per-round oracle — a cold, read-only Gemini
pass (primary, doc inlined into the prompt, no file access or sandbox needed) plus an
optional local second opinion via Ollama. All judges must produce a `VERDICT: READY` or
`VERDICT: NOT READY` line; anything else, or a disagreement, is **exit 2** (fail-closed).
Consensus is AND: READY only when every judge that ran says READY. See the script's header
comments for full behavioral notes.

Run it standalone to test:

```bash
bash /path/to/goldfish-judge.sh ./elephant.md
echo "exit: $?"

# With a second opinion from a local Ollama model:
OLLAMA_MODEL=llama3.1 bash /path/to/goldfish-judge.sh ./elephant.md
echo "exit: $?"
```

Exit codes: `0` = all judges READY · `10` = any judge NOT READY · `2` = any judge errored / empty / no verdict.

## Acceptance provenance

Give each requirement a stable ID and verification method. The deterministic handoff renderer preserves discovery/spec text and writes `handoff.manifest.json` with their hashes, output hash and requirement IDs. Compare the manifest before implementation; a mismatched file requires re-rendering. A fresh session is a choice to evaluate, not proof of better judgment. Preserve constraints and rejected alternatives in the handoff.
