🐒 This is the "I say so" step — the only sanctioned way to delete ape's clones.

1. Workspace: `~/tmp/repo-research/<project-slug>/` (slug = current directory basename). If it doesn't exist, say so and stop.
2. Show `du -sh` for the top-level `repos/`, each `reports/run.*/repos/`, and every
   `studies/<owner>__<repo>/repos/` directory, then list their contents so the user sees
   exactly what is about to go. Use `Glob`, not an unbounded filesystem search, to resolve
   the study clone directories.
3. Ask the user to confirm.
4. On confirmation, run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/clean-ape-workspace.sh <parent-of-each-listed-repos-directory> --confirm` once per directory shown above. Each call deletes that parent's `repos/` only. Keep every fingerprint, report, and `RECOMMENDATIONS.md` for inspection and re-synthesis.
5. Only if the user passed `--all` (or explicitly asks): run `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/clean-ape-workspace.sh <workspace-path> --all --confirm` after a second confirmation.
