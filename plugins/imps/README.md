# imps — swarm orchestrator for Claude Code

## Platforms

| Claude Code | OpenCode | Agy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| native (this README) — full swarm, `Workflow`-driven | full — generated, except `/imps:imps` (see below) | full — generated |

The orchestration prose ports, but the Claude `Workflow` script that drives it does
not run on either target. `/imps:prs`, `/imps:issue-mode`, and `/imps:imp-agency`
dispatch fine on both: model tiers are passed at invocation via `opencode run -m`
(OpenCode, never as frontmatter) or serial `agy -p`, inspecting response content
rather than exit status (Agy — see `docs/platform-matrix.md` Item 8). **`/imps:imps`
on OpenCode is unsupported**, though: its dispatch mechanism was the
`opencode-dispatch.sh` execute-tier harness, which has been removed from the Claude
Code source with no replacement — see the notice at the top of
`build/overrides/imps/opencode/commands/imps.md`. `/imps:imps` on Agy is unaffected
(same serial `agy -p` dispatch as the other commands). Per-platform dispatch prose
comes from `build/overrides/imps/`; generated output lives under `dist/opencode/` and
`dist/agy/imps/`. See
[`docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md`](../../docs/plans/cross-platform-compat.md) and
[`docs/platform-matrix.md`](../../docs/platform-matrix.md) for how and why.

## What it does

`/imps:imps` decomposes a task (or a batch of GitHub issues) into model-routed agents
("imps") — parallel when the work splits into independent units, solo when it's genuinely
one — dispatches them as staged background subagents, and integrates results through
deterministic gates and an adversarial **Head Imp** review. An optional five-persona
review panel runs on top when you pass `--personas` (see [Runtime flags](#runtime-flags)).

The orchestrating session is deliberately minimal: it holds only the operator-facing
work (the run's autonomy contract, then only genuine failures) while everything
else — dispatch, imp monitoring, merges, diffs, gate logs, persona traffic,
finalize — is real control flow inside a **`Workflow` script**
(`scripts/imps-run.workflow.js`), not a subagent. The command syncs the bundled script
into `~/.claude/workflows/` and invokes it fresh on every run (plugins can't ship a
runnable `Workflow` directly); the script's own opening step reads the run's state file
and resumes from wherever it left off, so long runs never grind the main context down —
the harness tracks the script's internal `agent()` dispatches separately from the calling
session's transcript, the same isolation property the old subagent-based design achieved
by hand.

## Prerequisites

| Requirement | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| **`gh` CLI** (authenticated) | Issue-driven mode (issue reads, PR creates, CI checks). |
| **GitHub MCP** (`mcp__github__*`) | PR/issue reads in `/imps:prs`; improves issue-driven mode. |
| **Bundled agent types** (`🦇`, `😈`, `👺`) | Registered automatically once installed (`agents/*.md`). If registration fails for any reason, `agent()` calls inside the Workflow script fall back the same way any Agent-tool call does. |
| **The `Workflow` tool** | **Hard dependency for the free-text run — no fallback.** `/imps:imps` syncs `scripts/imps-run.workflow.js` into `~/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js` and invokes it; if `Workflow` is unavailable in the session, the command stops and says so rather than falling back to an inline protocol. |

Optional:

| Requirement | Needed for |
| --- | --- |
| **`CLAUDE_CDP_URL`** env var | Browser panel via CDP (default `ws://localhost:3000`). Point at a headless-Chrome container, local or LAN. |
| **Claude-in-Chrome MCP** | Browser panel fallback if no CDP endpoint is reachable. |
| **`~/.claude/scripts/persona-post.sh`** implementing the protocol in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/persona-posting.md`, with per-persona GitHub App identities whose credentials live in your secret store | `/imps:issue-mode`'s persona reviews only. The free-text run's panel never posts — its verdicts always return inline. |

## Install

```sh
claude plugin install imps@seankoji
```

Or via the marketplace:

```sh
claude plugin marketplace add seankoji/claude-plugins
claude plugin install imps@seankoji
```

### Personal Codex command

From a checkout of this repository, install the maintained Codex translation as a
personal skill:

```sh
repo_root="$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)"
mkdir -p "$HOME/.agents/skills"
ln -s "$repo_root/plugins/imps/codex-skills/imps" "$HOME/.agents/skills/imps"
```

Invoke it explicitly with `$imps <task>`. This adapter uses native Codex subagents and
worktrees in the active task; it does not run Claude's background `Workflow` script.

## Usage

Four entry modes, auto-detected from the argument:

| Invocation | Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `/imps:imps <free-text task>` | Free-text | Refine → plan (opus plan mode) → decompose → hand to the Workflow script (staged dispatch → merge → gates → endstate PR; persona panel only with `--personas`) |
| `/imps:imps 42 43 51` | Issue-driven | Scout issues → rolling dispatch in isolated worktrees → holding branch → gates → operator handoff (persona panel only with `--personas`) |
| `/imps:imps https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/discussions/284` | Discussion-seed | Fetch the discussion via GraphQL, seed it as the free-text task, run the normal free-text flow, and always post a summary comment back to the discussion at the end |
| `/imps:imps path/to/checklist.md` | Checklist-file | Run each `Verify:`/`Done when:` item as a read-only audit, then offer remediation dispatch |

### Runtime flags

| Flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--personas` | off | Opt into the in-run five-persona review panel (solution-architect, grumpy-engineer, sre, business-analyst, ux-designer). **Without it, no persona panel runs** on either the free-text or issue-driven path — the adversarial **Head Imp** review (plan + diff) is the gate. Intended for repos whose PRs already receive persona reviews from a GitHub-side automation, where an in-run panel would just duplicate that. Combine freely with any mode: `/imps:imps --personas 42 43`, `/imps:imps --personas fix the parser`. The flag is stripped before mode detection, so it never affects which mode is selected. |

Note: issue-driven mode has no Head Imp gate of its own, so with `--personas` off its
review path is the deterministic gates plus whatever review your PR draws on GitHub —
only turn the panel off there if such a PR review genuinely exists.


### Free-text mode walkthrough

1. `/imps:imps` with a task description (or empty — it will ask).
2. `/imps:imps` triages the brief — a brief naming a concrete deliverable and at least one repo anchor (file, path, command, symptom) passes through verbatim to four discovery questions; a thinner one gets an interrogation instead (drawing on `references/brief-probes.md`, and replacing those questions rather than adding to them). Either way it then enters plan mode (opus) to decompose and write `GOAL.md` (to `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md`, not the repo — see [Runtime state](#runtime-state)). The constraints question feeds a `## Global Constraints` section in `GOAL.md` — cross-cutting invariants, stated verbatim, that every task must honor; unlike the Definition of Done (true once, ticked, verified), constraints are true of every task and never ticked. Every code-writing or code-reviewing agent call the script makes receives it by pointer, not by copy.
3. The Head Imp (opus) adversarially reviews the plan; findings are addressed before dispatch.
4. After plan approval, `/imps:imps` syncs and invokes the Workflow script, then returns control — `Workflow` runs in the background, and you're notified when it reaches a result. The script does the git preflight, dispatches the task DAG as staged `agent()` calls, and tracks progress in the run state file, so progress is `cat ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` (the imps run inside the script's own tracked execution, invisible to the main session's transcript the same way the old subagent design was).
5. When the imps finish, the script merges branches, syncs master, runs gates, then sends the merged diff to read-only OpenCode review. ChatGPT OAuth is preferred; OpenRouter is opt-in. Claude fixes blocker/major findings, reruns gates, and OpenCode reviews the fresh diff in a new session. Setup or verdict failure blocks rather than falling back to Claude. Only approval reaches `awaiting_authorization`, and the final summary names the provider and model.

### Issue-driven mode walkthrough

1. `/imps:imps 42 43 51` — all tokens are issue numbers.
2. Scouts (haiku) fan out in parallel per issue; results seed the implementation queue.
3. Implementation agents run in isolated worktrees up to `PARALLEL_CAP=6` concurrent; file-overlapping issues serialize naturally.
4. After all issues merge into the holding branch, `/imps:imps` runs full gates, opens the integration PR, and runs the persona panel **only if you passed `--personas`** (otherwise it goes straight to handoff after gates).
5. Operator handoff — `/imps:imps` does NOT merge the integration PR.

### Discussion-seed mode walkthrough

1. `/imps:imps https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/discussions/284` (or the bare `discussion 284` inside that repo).
2. `/imps:imps` fetches the discussion's title, body, and comments via `gh api graphql` (Discussions have no REST endpoint) and uses that content as the task description, skipping the "what's the task?" prompt.
3. Everything from there follows the free-text mode walkthrough above (discovery → plan → dispatch → integration).
4. Regardless of what the discovery answers say about output artifacts, the Workflow script always posts one summary comment back to the source discussion once the run finalizes (or a short abort notice if the run is aborted) — this is not optional and does not require a PR to exist.

### Checklist-file mode

Pass a single `.md` token that resolves to a file with `- [ ]` checklist items, each having `Verify:` and `Done when:` sub-lines. `/imps:imps` fans out read-only verification imps and emits a pass/fail audit report, then offers to dispatch remediation.

### Direct `/imps:issue-mode` invocation & handoff contract

Issue-driven mode is also directly invokable as `/imps:issue-mode` — useful for an upstream
audit or handoff tool that wants to skip `/imps:imps`'s mode detection. It accepts either bare
issue numbers (`/imps:issue-mode 42 43 51`) or a structured JSON input:

```json
{ "issues": [42, 43, 51, 60], "holdingBranch": "audit/2026-06-12" }
```

- `issues` (required) — the issue numbers to work (capped at `ISSUE_CAP=200`).
- `holdingBranch` (optional) — the branch to integrate onto; defaults to
  `swarm/<YYYY-MM-DD>` cut fresh from the repo's default branch. If the branch and its
  tracking issue already exist, the run resumes from the first incomplete phase.

## Sub-commands

Self-rescheduling via `ScheduleWakeup` — do NOT wrap it with `/loop`.

- **`/imps:prs`** — proactive PR monitor. After `/imps:imps` pushes and creates the endstate PR, activate this to automatically address review comments, fix CI failures, and resolve merge conflicts. Stops when the PR is merged, closed, or 48 h old.
- **`/imps:blast-radius`** — read-only, proof-led analysis of a PR, diff, commit range,
  or file change. Traces consumers outside the edited lines and reports which risks reached
  executable proof, which were cleared, and which remain unproven. It never fixes or
  publishes findings.

## `/imps:imp-agency` — audit → imps-ready plan

The upstream counterpart to a remediation run: a **read-only whole-repo health audit** that
produces a `/imps:imps` checklist-file plan, so the audit and the fix are one continuous
loop (`/imps:imp-agency` → `/clear` → `/imps:imps <plan>`).

The main session does one thing in its own context — resolve the project profile and show
it to the user as a gate — then hands the whole audit to a single **imp-agency** subagent
(unlike the free-text run, this path is unchanged: a single-segment subagent, not a
Workflow script — see [What it does](#what-it-does)). Inside it, one finder per applicable
dimension (`purpose`, `docs`, `ci`, `tests`, `security`, `performance`, `ux`, `stack`,
`ops`, `dx`, `verification`) fans out as nested background `imp` agents (the Workflow tool is not
available to subagents), every P0/P1 finding is adversarially refuted, a completeness
critic catches the suspiciously-clean dimension, and the survivors are synthesized into
the checklist plan.

**Effectiveness before craftsmanship.** The `purpose` finder audits fitness for purpose —
does each component earn its existence against the repo's reason-for-being (confirmed by
you at the profile gate)? It may verdict **delete**; delete verdicts face a 2-of-3
refuter panel, supersede fix findings on the same component, and land in an
operator-decision section of the plan — imps never auto-delete. If you wouldn't accept
"delete this component" as a finding, `--focus` away from `purpose`. The orchestrator gets back only the plan's `## Context` block and the item split —
finder returns, refuter traffic, and critic output never touch its context.

**Model routing follows reasoning shape.** The wrangler shell (dispatch/monitor/merge) is
sonnet; the parts with real analysis are upgraded: the deep-judgment finders (`purpose`,
`stack`, `security`, `performance`, `tests`) and every adversarial refuter run on **opus**,
synthesis is an **opus** sub-call (it writes the most-read output), and the
cross-dimension completeness critic runs on **fable** — the widest-decision-space call —
falling back to opus where Fable isn't available. The evidence-gathering finders (`docs`,
`ci`, `ux`, `ops`, `dx`, `verification`) stay on sonnet: a stronger model doesn't find
more stale docs or missing lint gates. The `verification` finder inventories and drives
existing project-local launch, doctor, scenario, evidence, and cleanup paths, then
distinguishes harness gaps from product defects.

```
/imps:imp-agency [--focus docs,tests,security] [--out /abs/path/plan.md]
```

- `--focus` (optional) — restrict to a subset of the dimension keys; default is all applicable.
- `--out` (optional) — where to write the plan (absolute, whitespace-free, **outside the
  repo** — the audit is read-only there). Default: `~/.claude/audits/<repo>-<date>.md`.

Every checklist item is a claim about the fixed end-state with a read-only `Verify:` command
that **fails now and passes once fixed** — so `/imps:imps <plan>` re-verifies each, reports
the failures, and offers to dispatch remediation. Read-only throughout: the only write is the
plan file outside the repo.

## The persona panel

**Opt-in — the panel runs only when you pass `--personas`** (see
[Runtime flags](#runtime-flags)). By default the Head Imp review is the gate and this
whole panel is skipped; the briefs below describe what runs when the flag is set.

Five reviewer briefs, each argued from a distinct, deliberately-conflicting lens.
Bundled at `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/` — no manual setup needed.

| Slug | Name | Lens | Type | Model |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `solution-architect` | Bramble | Boundaries, contracts, coupling — "should this exist, in this shape?" | code | opus |
| `grumpy-engineer` | Grudge | Edge cases, error paths, lazy shortcuts — "is this line correct?" | code | opus |
| `sre` | Klaxon | Failure modes, ops, idempotency, resource limits — "what does the operator see at 3am?" | code | opus |
| `business-analyst` | Ledger | Diff satisfies each issue's acceptance criteria — "did we build the right thing?" | code | opus |
| `ux-designer` | Glint | Hierarchy, affordance, consistency, mobile — "what does the user actually see?" | browser | sonnet |

Each persona ends its review with a parseable verdict line:
```
VERDICT: APPROVE | CHANGES_REQUESTED @ <sha>
```
`CHANGES_REQUESTED` requires at least one `[blocker]` or `[major]` finding. Minors and
nits are recorded but never block. **The panel never posts to GitHub.** Every verdict
returns inline in `run_complete.findings_inline` for the operator to read, or post by
hand. Personas previously published real PR reviews under dedicated GitHub App
identities; that was removed once the OCR review rounds became this run's on-the-record
code review, since five bot-authored approvals of a diff the same session wrote read as
independent sign-off without being it.

`/imps:issue-mode` still posts persona reviews under App identities, and the protocol for
it lives in `references/persona-posting.md`.

Findings survive up to three fix rounds. A `WONTFIX: <rationale>` in any round is captured, not
discarded — every rationale is retained as a `wontfix_rulings` entry and rendered in the run's
terminal result, not just the state file.

### When findings still don't converge

If dissenting findings remain after the three-round cap, one opus adjudicator rules on each,
anchored to at least one of: a named `## Definition of Done` criterion (quoted verbatim); a
concrete breaking input, data-loss path, or security defect in the merged diff; or a named
`## Global Constraints` violation (quoted verbatim) — a finding meeting none of the three
anchors cannot be ruled `load-bearing`. Each ruling is one of `parked-contestable`,
`parked-deferred`, `load-bearing`, or `operator-overridden`. A `load-bearing` ruling blocks the
run: the Workflow script returns a `blocked` result with `reason: "unresolved_findings"`, and you
choose `retry findings` (one more capped fix cycle, refused after two cycles) or
`override findings: <rationale>` (converts every `load-bearing` ruling to `operator-overridden`,
records your rationale, and proceeds to finalize). Every non-`load-bearing` ruling — and every
override — is written into `GOAL.md`'s `## Parked findings` section, so a run's disagreements have
a durable, readable record even after the state file is deleted at finalize.

## Bundled assets

| Asset | Location |
| --- | --- |
| Persona briefs (5) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/<slug>.md` |
| Persona posting-identity protocol (shared) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/persona-posting.md` |
| `🦇` agent type | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/imp.md` |
| `😈` agent type | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/head-imp.md` |
| `👺` agent type (audit orchestrator) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/imp-agency.md` |
| Free-text run's Workflow script | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-run.workflow.js` — synced to `~/.claude/workflows/imps-run-<sha8>.js` on every invocation (content-addressed, so concurrent runs on different plugin versions never swap it under each other) |
| Checklist-file mode workflow | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/checklist-mode.md` |
| Discussion-seed mode workflow | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/discussion-mode.md` |
| Summon banner (cosmetic) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py` |
| Dispatch banner (cosmetic) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dispatch-banner.py` |
| Final banner (cosmetic) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/final-banner.py` |
| Structured audit-log appender | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/audit-log.sh` |
| Run slug/path derivation (single source of truth) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh` |
| Run-worktree manager (concurrent runs) | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh` |
| Locked learnings appender | `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-learnings-append.sh` |

No manual setup needed for any of these — the plugin installs them at
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` and the commands resolve them at runtime. The bundled
`😈` agent type resolves whenever anything invokes it via the `Agent` tool
(`Agent(subagent_type: "imps:😈", ...)`).

## Runtime state

Written to `~/.claude/imps/` on first run — not bundled:

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` | Per-run state — resume spine, owned by the Workflow script after handover; it heartbeats `last_heartbeat` + `tasks_done` while imps run, so `cat` this file for live progress. Every invocation of the script is fresh (never `resumeFromRunId`) — this file, plus git ground truth, is the entire resume mechanism |
| `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md` | Per-run `GOAL.md` spine (`/compact`-durable), including the final nontrivial decision trail — lives here, not in the repo, so writing it never needs project-directory permission |
| `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.prs.json` | Per-PR monitor state for `/imps:prs` |
| `~/.claude/imps/learnings.md` | Self-tuning `## Active rules` (≤10 bullets) + per-run notes |
| `~/.claude/audit.jsonl` | One structured JSON line per completed run — shared across plugins in this marketplace (schema in the root `AGENTS.md`) |

The slug is derived by `scripts/imps-paths.sh` from the **working tree**
(`git rev-parse --show-toplevel`), disambiguated by the remote — e.g.
`seankoji_claude-plugins__claude-plugins`. Two worktrees of one repo therefore get two
slugs, which is what keeps concurrent runs apart (see below).

## Concurrent runs against one repo

Several `/imps:imps` runs can work on the same repo at once — **one run per git worktree,
each in its own session.**

The reason it needs a worktree rather than just a second session is that every
orchestration step (cutting the run branch, merging imp branches, running gates, pushing
the PR) acts on the session's own checkout. Two runs sharing one checkout share one HEAD,
so one run's `git checkout -b` sends the other's merges onto the wrong branch. Separate
worktrees make each run's cwd correct by construction. (The individual code imps were
always isolated — the harness gives each its own worktree — so only the orchestrator
needed one.)

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" new [name]   # create a run worktree
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" list         # what is running where
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" remove <name>
```

`new` creates a detached worktree at `<repo>.imps/<name>`, beside the main checkout — not
inside the repo (where gates and globs would see it) and not inside `.claude/worktrees/`
(which Claude Code manages). `remove` refuses while that worktree still has a state file,
since that file is the run's only resume handle.

Two steps are yours, not the script's:

1. **Install dependencies in the new worktree.** A fresh worktree has no `node_modules`
   or venv, and gates run in the session's own tree.
2. **Start the new session with that worktree as its cwd** — a command cannot relocate
   the session it runs in.

Runs in different worktrees share no state file, run branch or PR. Of what remains
shared: the workflow script is content-addressed, `$TMPDIR` scratch files are
slug-namespaced, and `~/.claude/imps/learnings.md` is appended under a lock. The one
thing worth knowing about is git's auto-gc, which rewrites `packed-refs` and can race
`git worktree add` — `imps-worktree.sh` prints the `gc.auto 0` advisory once a second
worktree exists.

The `learnings.md` `## Active rules` section is read at startup on every run and applied
to model routing, task boundaries, and dependency detection. `/imps:imps` appends a new run
entry after each completed run; confirmed learnings are promoted into Active rules. The
Workflow script also appends a structured `audit.jsonl` entry at finalize — best-effort,
skipped with a warning (not a failure) if `jq` is missing.

## Browser review (optional)

The persona panel includes a browser half when the diff touches a renderable UI surface.
Transport is resolved in order:

1. **CDP endpoint** — set `CLAUDE_CDP_URL` (e.g. `ws://localhost:3000` or
   `ws://<lan-host>:3000` for a remote rig). Connect via `chromium.connectOverCDP` —
   never `connect()` (hangs); never pass `http://` (returns 426).
2. **Chrome MCP fallback** — if no CDP endpoint is reachable, the panel uses
   `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools (requires the Claude-in-Chrome extension).
3. **No browser** — neither available → panel runs code-only; skip is noted in the report.

Repos with no UI surface skip the browser half entirely.

## Verified outcomes and recovery

Implementation runs use the [verified workflow contract](references/workflow-contract.md): stable requirement IDs, revision-bound evidence, checks before independent review, and fresh verification after repairs. Required unverified outcomes block completion. The contract documents helper commands, process timeouts, ownership recovery, runtime limitations and evaluation. Codex-first diff review reuses the adapter work from PR #258; plan routing incorporates PR #263.
