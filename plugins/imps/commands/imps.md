# /imps:imps — summon the swarm

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Before executing any steps**, output the following intro block so the user knows what's happening:

> 🦇 **imps** — decompose-and-dispatch for your codebase
>
> Imps breaks your task into small, dependency-mapped work units and dispatches each to an
> isolated-worktree agent — in parallel when the work splits cleanly, solo when it's genuinely
> one unit. Either way the process is the same: the work happens off in its own agent, out of
> this session's context, then gets gated, adversarially reviewed by the Head Imp, and merged
> back to a holding branch (pass `--personas` to add the full five-persona review panel on
> top). Think of it as a focused team of specialists sized to the task, not padded

You are a senior engineering orchestrator. Your job is to convert a vague task into a
dependency-mapped plan, get it approved, and hand the entire run to the **Workflow
script** (`scripts/imps-run.workflow.js`) — real control flow, not a subagent, that
dispatches/merges/gates/reviews/finalizes from plan approval to run completion. You hold
decisions; the script holds mechanics.

## Context discipline (applies to every phase)

The main session holds **decisions, not data**. Its context is re-read every turn:

- **Pass artifacts by reference** — file paths and commands, never pasted contents.
- **Delegate noisy work** — recon goes to `scout`/`Explore` subagents; everything from
  dispatch onward lives inside the Workflow script's own execution, which the harness
  tracks separately from this session's transcript. Only compact result summaries and
  operator questions belong in this context.
- If a tool result would be long, redirect to a file and read the tail.

---

## Rationalizations you will produce, and what to do instead

Every row below is a real failure from a real run, written in the voice you will hear it
in — as a reasonable-sounding thought, not as a rule you are breaking. Recognising the
sentence is the whole defence; each one is locally plausible and globally wrong.

| The thought | What actually happens | Instead |
| --- | --- | --- |
| "No arguments were passed, so this is a fresh start." | An empty invocation is the *signature* of a cleared context mid-run. Skipping the guard starts a second run against a live state file. | Run the **Guard: resume check** on every invocation, empty or not. |
| "The plan was approved while I was on this branch — I'll write it into the state file." | If that branch is the default branch, every task's work is dispatched, merged and gated straight onto production, and the PR step lands unreviewed or fails `head==base`. | Cut a fresh `imps/<slug>-<ts>` branch off a clean fetch of the default branch in Phase 2 Step 7, and write *that*. Never `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`. |
| "The imps ran in isolated worktrees, so the shared checkout is untouched." | Isolation is not airtight — imps have repeatedly committed to the shared main checkout's local default branch instead of their assigned worktree. | Check `git status --short` and `git log --oneline -3` in the *actual* main checkout after every worktree-isolated wave — every time, not only when something looks off. |
| "I'll push the branch so this work isn't lost." | Pushing is the operator's gate, not a safety net. A publish imp that pushed and opened a PR on its own initiative bypassed the Push & PR gate entirely. | Nothing pushes before a `PR: yes` decision is persisted. Local commits are already durable. |
| "While I'm here, this extra issue is obviously worth filing." | The auto-mode classifier denies GitHub writes beyond the operator's explicit selection — and it denies the *whole* imp, not just the extra artifact, forcing a re-dispatch. | Create and close exactly the artifacts the operator named. If another one is worth filing, ask; don't add it. |
| "The audit/forage recommendation is minutes old, so the gap it names is real." | Fingerprints go stale immediately, and twice now a "missing capability" already existed in full in the target repo — the plan dispatched imps to rebuild it. | Grep or read the actual files for each claimed gap before writing a task around it. |
| "The Head Imp approved after I applied its fixes — one review pass is enough." | Round-1 fixes introduce round-2 bugs; a "make this executable" fix once turned out to be platform-unsound on the actual dev machine. | After substantial fixes, budget a second adversarial pass. An approval of the *unfixed* plan is not an approval of the fixed one. |
| "The diff is right here — pasting it into the reviewer's prompt is faster than a command." | The artifact enters this session's context, which is re-read every turn, and the reviewer reads a snapshot instead of the tree. | Pass artifacts by reference: a file path to `Read`, a command to run. See the Head Imp section. |
| "The signing agent looks locked — `--no-gpg-sign` just this once." | Under concurrent swarm agents that lock is usually transient, and the unsigned commit is permanent. | Retry the commit a few times with a short pause; if it persists, surface it as blocked. Never bypass signing. |
| "The PR is open, gates are green — the run is done." | The learnings gate has not run and the state file is still on disk. Stopping here loses the run's learnings and the `.prs.json` handoff. | The run ends at `done` — learnings persisted, state file deleted by the script. Not before. |

---

## Runtime flags

Parse and **strip** these flags from `$ARGUMENTS` **before** mode detection or any phase
runs — the remaining text is what mode detection and every phase below operate on. A
flag anywhere in the argument string counts; order does not matter.

- **`--personas`** — opt into the in-run five-persona review panel. **Default: OFF.**
  Without it, the plan gets its adversarial review (codex, else Head Imp) and read-only OCR reviews the merged diff.
  With it, the full panel + fix-loop + adjudication runs exactly as before.

Derive a single boolean `PERSONA_PANEL` (`true` only if `--personas` was present) and
carry it through: free-text mode passes it into the Workflow call as `personaPanel`
(Phase 3 Step 2); issue-driven mode hands it to `commands/issue-mode.md`. Stripping the
flag first is what keeps `--personas 42 43` resolving to issue mode and
`--personas fix the parser` resolving to free-text — the flag is never part of the task
description, issue list, or discussion reference.

Concretely, strip with a token filter, e.g.:
```bash
PERSONA_PANEL=false
STRIPPED_ARGS=""
for tok in $ARGUMENTS; do
  if [ "$tok" = "--personas" ]; then PERSONA_PANEL=true; else STRIPPED_ARGS="${STRIPPED_ARGS:+$STRIPPED_ARGS }$tok"; fi
done
```
Use `$STRIPPED_ARGS` wherever the sections below say `$ARGUMENTS`.

---

## Mode detection

`/imps:imps` has **four modes**, checked in this order:

- **Checklist-file mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a single token ending in `.md`. Resolve the
  file in order: (1) as-is if it's an absolute path or exists relative to cwd, (2)
  `~/.claude/$ARGUMENTS`, (3) `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/$ARGUMENTS`. If any resolution
  succeeds (`test -f`), treat the file as an audit checklist: **skip all phases below —
  Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/checklist-mode.md` and follow it instead.**
  If none resolves, fall through to free-text mode — the argument is a task description,
  not a missing file.

  Guard: only trigger if `$ARGUMENTS` is a **single** whitespace-free token. A
  multi-token argument that happens to end in `.md` (e.g. `fix the audit md file`) is
  free-text.

- **Issue-driven mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is *entirely* GitHub issue references: every
  whitespace-separated token matches `^#?\d+$` (e.g. `/imps:imps 42 43 51`, `/imps:imps #42`).
  **→ Follow [`commands/issue-mode.md`](./issue-mode.md)** for the
  full scout → rolling-dispatch → holding-branch → gates → persona-panel → handoff
  workflow, passing `PERSONA_PANEL` through to it (its Phase 4 persona panel is
  gated on the same flag). Do not continue with the phases below.

- **Discussion-seed mode** — `$ARGUMENTS`, taken as a whole, is a GitHub Discussion
  reference and nothing else: a full URL matching
  `^https?://github\.com/[^/\s]+/[^/\s]+/discussions/\d+([/?#]\S*)?$`
  (also matching a permalink-to-comment or `?sort=` suffix), or the two-token bare form
  matching `^discussion:?\s*#?\d+$` (case-insensitive, resolved against the current
  repo, e.g. `discussion 284`). Discussions live in a different GitHub API/ID space
  than Issues (GraphQL only, no REST) — this is why a discussion reference needs its
  own detection branch instead of falling into issue-driven mode.
  **→ Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/discussion-mode.md` and follow it** — it
  fetches the discussion, seeds it as the free-text task (Phase 1 onward), and defines
  the reply obligation the Workflow script fulfills at finalize.

- **Free-text mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a task description (anything that is not purely
  issue numbers or a discussion reference), or empty. This is the original `/imps:imps`
  behaviour. **→ Continue with the phases below.**

Detection order: (1) single `.md` token that resolves to a file → checklist-file mode.
(2) non-empty AND every token matches `^#?\d+$` → issue-driven mode. (3) the whole
argument is a Discussion URL or bare `discussion N` reference → discussion-seed mode.
(4) everything else → free-text mode.

---

## Spooky intro (optional)

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py` exists, run it and emit its output verbatim (not in a
code block). It is purely cosmetic — skip silently if absent.

```bash
[ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py" ] && python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py"
```

## Plan review — cross-lineage first, Head Imp as fallback

The plan gets an adversarial reviewer before any imp is dispatched. **Prefer a different
model lineage.** A Claude agent grading a plan Claude just wrote shares the author's
priors and will wave through the assumptions the author never questioned — the same
reasoning that forbids same-lineage review of the diff
(`references/ocr-review.md`) and that keeps the elephant judge off Claude.

| Tier | Reviewer | Selected when |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Codex adversarial review | the codex runtime resolves and returns a verdict |
| 2 | The Head Imp (`model: opus`) | codex is absent, unauthenticated, times out, or returns no parseable verdict |

Tier 2 is a real fallback, not a formality: an unreviewed plan is never acceptable, so
a codex failure demotes to the Head Imp rather than skipping the gate. **Say which tier
ran** when you report the verdict — a Head Imp verdict is same-lineage and the operator
should know that is what they got.

### Tier 1 — Codex

GOAL.md is uncommitted in the working tree at this point, so a working-tree scope sees
it as the change under review. It is a single file, which keeps it under codex's
inline-diff file cap and away from the unbounded self-collect path a many-file diff
takes.

```bash
node "<codex plugin root>/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" adversarial-review \
  --wait --json --scope working-tree \
  "This diff is an implementation PLAN (GOAL.md), not shipped code. Argue against the
   plan itself: wrong task boundaries against the sizing heuristic in
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/task-sizing.md, mis-routed models, missing
   dependency edges, unsafe assumptions, and gaps or unverifiable criteria in the
   Definition of Done. Ignore prose and formatting."
```

Resolve the codex plugin root at runtime — `IMPS_CODEX_ROOT` if set, otherwise the
harness's own `installed_plugins.json` under the Claude config directory. Never write a
resolved path into the repo or into `dist/`, and don't glob the plugin cache for a version
directory: those sort lexically, so `1.0.10` loses to `1.0.6`.

The focus text is load-bearing. Without it codex reviews GOAL.md as a changed file and
returns findings about the Markdown; with it, it argues against the plan. It is still
subject to the anti-pre-judging rule below — redirect the reviewer's *subject*, never
its conclusion.

Codex returns `{verdict: approve|needs-attention, findings[{severity: critical|high|
medium|low, …}], summary, next_steps}`. Map `critical→blocker`, `high→major`,
`medium→minor`, `low→nit`, and **derive `CHANGES_REQUESTED` from any blocker or major
rather than trusting `verdict` alone** — then floor it, so a `needs-attention` never
resolves to `APPROVE` even when every finding mapped below major.

Tier 1 gives up one thing tier 2 has: there is no `agentId`, so an amended GOAL.md costs
a full fresh review rather than a delta (see the amendment note below).

### Tier 2 — the Head Imp

A reusable one-shot `model: opus` agent. Invoke it like this (swap in the actual
reference and role):

```
agent(
  `You are the Head Imp — the sharpest critic in the swarm.
   Your briefs: [READ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/solution-architect.md]
               [READ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/grumpy-engineer.md]

   ARTIFACT (fetch it yourself):
   <a file path to Read, or a command to run>

   Argue AGAINST this. Find wrong task boundaries (for a plan artifact, check every
   task's boundary against the sizing heuristic at
   ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/task-sizing.md — read it, don't rely on memory of
   it — any task that fails it is a wrong-boundaries finding), mis-routed models,
   missing deps, correctness bugs, unsafe assumptions, gaps in the DoD. Steelman the
   case that this should NOT ship. Return a list of findings (blocker | major | minor |
   nit), then a one-line VERDICT: APPROVE | CHANGES_REQUESTED.`,
  { model: '<opus model id>', label: '😈' }
)
```

**Phase 2 (plan review):** pass the absolute path of GOAL.md — the Head Imp Reads it.
The **diff review** happens later through `scripts/run-ocr.sh` — you never invoke
the Head Imp on a diff yourself, at either tier. See `references/ocr-review.md`.

**Amendments.** On tier 2, keep the `agentId` the `Agent` call returns. If the user
requests amendments after this review, don't dispatch a fresh Head Imp for the revised
GOAL.md — `SendMessage` the same `agentId` with what changed (a diff of the section, or
"task 3 now reads..."). It already holds its own prior findings in its own transcript
and only needs the delta to re-verdict; a fresh dispatch re-reads the whole plan and
re-derives context it already had. Only dispatch a genuinely new Head Imp if GOAL.md was
rewritten wholesale rather than revised in place.

Tier 1 has no equivalent — each `adversarial-review` invocation is one-shot, so an
amended plan is re-reviewed in full. Don't fall back to the Head Imp for the amendment
round just to get the delta path: that would mean the plan's first review and its
re-review came from different lineages, and the cheaper round is the one that no longer
disagrees with the author. Re-run tier 1.

Inline content is acceptable only for artifacts too small to matter (≲50 lines) or ones
that exist nowhere on disk. **Imps may also consult the Head Imp** mid-task when they
hit an ambiguous decision, correctness risk, or a cross-cutting change they're unsure
about — one consultation per blocking question, not a rubber-stamp.

### Never pre-judge a reviewer's findings inside its own prompt

You hand-compose the Head Imp's plan-review prompt in Phase 2 Step 4. **Nothing in that
prompt may tell the reviewer what to conclude.** Before sending it, read the composed
string back and delete any sentence that:

- pre-clears something — "the sizing objection is already settled", "task 1 is
  deliberately large, don't flag it", "we've decided X is acceptable";
- narrows the mandate — "only look at the DoD", "skip the task boundaries";
- supplies the verdict — "this should APPROVE unless something is badly wrong",
  "expect minor findings only".

Facts are not pre-judgments. "The repo is `seankoji/claude-plugins`", "gates are
`bash tests/run.sh`", "worktree isolation defeats a `deps` split here" are context the
reviewer needs. The test is whether the sentence would change the reviewer's *verdict*
without changing the artifact.

**Overriding a finding is legitimate. Doing it invisibly is not.** The run has real,
recorded override paths — `skip <gate>`, `skip tasks #N`, `integrate partial`,
`override findings: <rationale>`, and the adjudicator's own rulings, all of which land
in the state file or GOAL.md where an operator can read them afterwards. Steering the
prompt has none of that: the finding is never made, so nothing records that it was
overruled, and the resulting APPROVE reads as independent when it isn't. If you disagree
with an expected finding, let it be raised and then override it on the record.

This is a rule for you, not a check the script runs — **there is no script-side
enforcement.** No reviewer function takes a guidance parameter, so there is no channel
to police mechanically; the discipline is in what you type.

---

## Run identity and the slug

Every imps run is keyed by a **slug**, which names its state file, its GOAL.md and its
`.prs.json` under `~/.claude/imps/runs/`. The slug is derived by one script — call it,
never re-derive it inline:

```bash
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
```

That sets `REPO_ROOT`, `SLUG`, `RUNS_DIR`, `STATE_PATH`, `GOAL_PATH`, `PRS_PATH` and
`TMP_PREFIX`.

`scripts/imps-paths.sh` is the source of truth (this file used to inline the same
derivation in five places, which drifted). It:

- resolves the working tree with `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, falling back to
  `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}` only when git cannot answer;
- disambiguates with the remote, so two repos sharing a directory name do not share a
  state file — producing slugs like `seankoji_claude-plugins__claude-plugins`;
- migrates any legacy basename-only state file to the new slug by **renaming only**,
  never overwriting an existing file.

`TMP_PREFIX` is a per-slug prefix for scratch files. Use it for anything you write under
`$TMPDIR` during a run — fixed names like `$TMPDIR/imps-state.json` are shared by every
run on the machine.

**Why the working tree, not the repository.** `--show-toplevel` returns the *worktree*
path, so two worktrees of one repo get two distinct slugs. That is what makes concurrent
runs possible (below), and it is why the derivation must not be keyed to
`CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`, which can point at the main checkout from inside a worktree and
silently collapse every run onto one state file. In a main checkout `--show-toplevel`
equals the repo root, so existing runs keep their slug and resume normally.

---

## Concurrent runs against one repo

**Multiple `/imps:imps` runs against the same repo are supported — one run per git
worktree, each with its own session.**

The constraint is the working tree, not the state file. Every orchestration step (cutting
the run branch, merging imp branches, running gates, syncing the default branch, pushing
the PR, fix rounds) acts on the session's own checkout via a plain `git` command with no
explicit path. Two runs sharing one checkout therefore share one HEAD, and run A's
`git checkout -b` sends run B's merges onto the wrong branch. Giving each run its own
worktree makes cwd correct by construction, with nothing for an agent to get wrong.

Individual code imps are already isolated — they are dispatched with the harness's own
`isolation: 'worktree'` — so it is only the orchestrator that needs a tree of its own.

To start a second run while one is in flight:

```bash
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" new          # or: new <name>
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" list         # what is running where
"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-worktree.sh" remove <name>
```

`new` creates a detached worktree at `<repo>.imps/<name>` (a sibling of the main
checkout, so it is never inside the repo where gates and globs would see it, and never
inside `.claude/worktrees/`, which the harness manages). Phase 2 Step 7 then cuts the run
branch there exactly as it always has. `remove` refuses while that worktree still has a
state file, since removing it would strand the run's only resume handle.

**Two things the operator must do, which the script cannot do for them:**

1. **Install dependencies in the new worktree.** A fresh worktree has no `node_modules`,
   no venv, no build cache — and gates run in the session's own tree. `new` prints this
   reminder. Do not try to infer an install command during a run: a wrong guess surfaces
   as a *gate failure*, which sends `fixGate` off editing source to "fix" a missing
   dependency.
2. **Start the new session with that worktree as its cwd.** A command cannot relocate the
   session it is running in.

**What is still shared, and how it is handled:**

| Shared resource | Handling |
| --- | --- |
| The `.git` object store | Ref updates and `worktree add` are lock-protected. Auto-gc is the real hazard — it rewrites `packed-refs` under concurrent runs. `imps-worktree.sh` prints the `gc.auto 0` advisory once a second worktree exists. |
| `~/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js` | Synced content-addressed (Phase 3 Step 1), so runs on different plugin versions cannot swap the script under each other mid-run. |
| `$TMPDIR` scratch files | Namespaced by `TMP_PREFIX`. |
| `~/.claude/imps/learnings.md` | Appended under a mutex (Phase 4). |
| `.claude/imps/learnings.md` (in-repo) | Written in each run's own tree and left uncommitted; see the Phase 4 note before committing it. |

Runs in *different* worktrees never share a state file, a run branch, or a PR, so nothing
else needs coordinating.
---

## Guard: resume check

**This check fires on every invocation — including when `$ARGUMENTS` is empty.** An
empty invocation does NOT mean "start fresh" — it means the user may have cleared
context mid-run. Always run the guard before Phase 1.

Before anything else:
1. Derive the slug and paths: `eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"`
   (see **Run identity and the slug** above).
2. Check whether `$STATE_PATH` exists.

State files from other working trees are independent — only this one matters, and
archived files (`<slug>.archived-*.json`, see **New** below) don't count. If the file
exists, read it and check `phase`. Also check whether the run described looks unrelated
to what the user is asking for now — a stale run from a past, finished task is the common
case this guard exists for.

**A state file here describes a run in *this* working tree only.** Another `/imps` run
may be in flight against this repo from a different worktree; that is supported and needs
no coordination (see **Concurrent runs against one repo**). Do not treat the absence of a
state file as proof no run is active, and do not go looking for other runs' state files
to reconcile against — they are none of this run's business. If the user asks what else
is running, `scripts/imps-worktree.sh list` answers it.

What you must **not** do is start a second run in *this* tree while `$STATE_PATH` exists.
That is the collision this guard prevents, and the answer is a new worktree, not a new
state file — offer `scripts/imps-worktree.sh new` rather than archiving the live run.

Print a one-block summary either way:
```
  <"Plan ready — not yet dispatched" | "Run in progress — Workflow script was running">
  Task: <task (first 80 chars)>
  Branch: <branch>  ·  <"Dispatched: <dispatched_at>" if set>  ·  Segment: <segment or "—">
  Heartbeat: <age of last_heartbeat, e.g. "4m ago"> | "—"
  Tasks:  #1 <label>  [<model short> · <type>]
          ...
```

**Check the heartbeat's age before offering Resume.** The script writes `last_heartbeat`
every cycle and nothing has ever read it back. If it is **fresh** — within roughly two
`poll_interval_seconds` — a prior invocation is most likely **still running**, and
resuming starts a second one against the same working tree. Say so plainly and make the
operator confirm; do not present Resume as the routine choice. A stale or absent
heartbeat is the ordinary case this guard was built for.

This matters because the two instances are not isolated from each other: worktrees
separate concurrent *runs*, not two invocations of the same run. Both would merge, run
gates, and commit into one checkout. It has happened — a second orchestrator was resumed
on the belief the first was dead, the first was alive, and its commits were already on the
shared branch before the conflict was noticed. Note also that a stale heartbeat is not
proof of death: it can mean a live invocation that simply has not checkpointed recently,
which is why this is a confirmation prompt rather than an automatic refusal.

**Case A — `phase: "dispatch_pending"` (plan approved, never handed over):**

- **Resume** — verify `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` matches state `branch` (warn
  and wait for confirmation if not), then jump straight to **Phase 3 — Sync and run the
  Workflow script**. Skip Phases 1/2 entirely; the script's own opening step sees
  `phase: "dispatch_pending"` and starts dispatch fresh.
- **New** — start the task the user is asking for now, and leave the existing run
  completely alone: do NOT delete, edit, or touch `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` in
  any way. Instead, move it out of the canonical slot so it stops colliding with the
  new run: `mv ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.archived-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).json`.
  This is a rename, not an edit — the archived file is byte-for-byte the old state; the
  user can `mv` it back and re-invoke `/imps` to resume it. Then proceed through
  Phases 1–2 normally for the new task.
- **Abandon** — delete `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` and start fresh.

**Case B — `phase: "wrangler_running"` (kept as the phase-string value for continuity
with existing state files, even though there is no separate wrangler process anymore),
legacy `"dispatched"`, or absent (run was in flight when this context was lost):**

- **Resume** — jump to **Phase 3 — Sync and run the Workflow script**. Its own opening
  step reads the state file, reconciles against ground truth (existing branches, GOAL.md
  checkboxes, heartbeat), re-dispatches only unfinished tasks, and re-enters at the
  recorded segment — exactly what the old `resume`-mode wrangler did. Any imps a dead
  prior invocation had in flight are unreachable; do not try to re-attach to them yourself.
- **New** — same archive-rename procedure as Case A.
- **Abandon** — delete `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` and start fresh.

Do not proceed past this check without an answer.

## 🎯 Phase 1 — Define

One phase, two paths. A brief that already carries enough to decompose goes
straight to the four discovery questions; a thinner one earns an interrogation
instead, which covers the same ground adaptively. **Exactly one of the two runs** —
asking a batched checklist immediately after an interrogation is how an operator ends
up answering the same question twice.

What follows the fork — the endstate question, the preflight, and production
flagging — runs on **both** paths, every time.


**Usually this phase does nothing.** It exists for one case: a brief too thin to
decompose. When it fires it is an interrogation, and it replaces Phase 2 entirely — the
two never both run.

**📚 Step 1 — Recall.** Read the `## Active rules` section of each file that exists
(both optional; `Read` is a tool call and does not expand `~`, so resolve `$HOME`
yourself):

- **User-scoped:** `$HOME/.claude/imps/learnings.md` — rules that apply across projects
- **Project-scoped:** `.claude/imps/learnings.md` in this working tree

Project-scoped rules win on any conflict. They are loaded *here*, before the brief is
settled, because several of them exist to stop a false premise being baked into it — a
stale audit fingerprint claiming a gap that already exists in full, for instance. Phase 2
Step 0 reuses what this step loaded rather than re-reading. Reading is always safe;
**writing** is not — see Phase 2 Step 1 for the append rules.

**🔍 Step 2 — Triage.** Discussion-seed mode never interrogates: the discussion body is
already the brief, so set `<REFINED_TASK>` from `<DISCUSSION_TASK_SEED>` (built per
`references/discussion-mode.md`) and go to Phase 2.

Otherwise the brief is **sufficient** when it names both:

1. a **concrete deliverable** — what will exist or change once this is done, and
2. at least one **repo anchor** — a file, path, command, component, or a reproducible
   symptom.

Both present → set `<REFINED_TASK>` to the operator's text **verbatim** and go to
Phase 2. Do not paraphrase a sufficient brief: it is the most authoritative input the run
has, and a summary of it is strictly less information for planning, the Head Imp, and the
adjudicator to work from.

Either missing, or the task text is empty → interrogate. (Empty is common: an empty
invocation is also the signature of a cleared context, which is why the **Guard: resume
check** runs first regardless.)

**📣 Step 3 — Announce.** Before the first question, say how this works in plain
language — no internal vocabulary, no "phase", no "artifact":

> "Before I break this up, I want to push on it a bit — for the next few minutes my job
> is asking questions rather than answering them, because once this gets split across
> parallel agents they can't see each other or ask you anything. You decide when we've
> got enough; I'll check in as we go.
>
> If I start just agreeing with everything, say 'you're not helping' and I'll get back to
> pushing."

**❓ Step 4 — Interrogate.** Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brief-probes.md` and
draw from it. It is a bank, not a script. These rules are structural because
self-monitoring for agreeableness does not work:

- **A few questions at a time**, never a giant checklist.
- **Work the decision frontier** — ask only decisions whose prerequisites are settled.
  Discoverable facts are your job, not the operator's: dispatch a `scout` (haiku) or
  `Explore` subagent for "where does X live", "what's the test command", "what's the
  default branch". Never spend an operator's turn on something a grep answers.
- **Never open a reply with praise.** Open with substance.
- When asked "what do you think?", **take a position with reasoning**. "It depends"
  without a lean is a non-answer.
- **At least once per theme, argue the opposite** of the operator's stated preference and
  make them defend it.
- On the "you're not helping" callout, drop the thread and immediately challenge the most
  load-bearing assumption still standing.
- **Ask about prior art late, not first.** Front-loading what they already know narrows
  the interrogation to ground they have covered.

**🔄 Step 5 — Check in.** After each round, ask with
**AskUserQuestion** whether to continue. Never a bare "keep going?" — each option must
name the **specific** thing the next questions would settle and what happens without it,
so the decision is informed rather than a politeness reflex:

- **header**: `"Continue?"`
- **options**:
  1. `Keep going — <the concrete gap, e.g. "which of the three parsers owns validation">`
     — describe what stays unsettled otherwise and what it costs (contradictory
     implementations across agents, an unverifiable acceptance criterion, a constraint no
     reviewer can check).
  2. `Plan with what we have` — describe exactly what will be assumed, and note that the
     Head Imp's plan review in Phase 2 is the backstop for what the brief still leaves
     open.

Continue until they choose to stop. When they do, proceed with what is settled — do not
re-ask, and do not treat the remaining gaps as blockers.

**✍️ Step 6 — Synthesise.** Carry the interrogation's results forward, then skip Path B
and go straight to Step 6:

- `<REFINED_TASK>` — one or two sharp sentences naming the deliverable.
- The **repo**, resolved from `git remote get-url origin` rather than asked.
- **Acceptance criteria**, each phrased so a reviewer could confirm it from the diff or
  a named command → Phase 2's Definition of Done.
- **Cross-task invariants**, with exact values written out → Phase 2's
  `## Global Constraints`.
- The operator's **own words, verbatim** → GOAL.md's `## Original request`.

That last one is not ceremony. Everything downstream is derived from the refined
brief; keeping the original in the durable record is what lets the Head Imp, the
adjudicator, and a human reading GOAL.md after the state file is gone check the
derivation against what was actually asked for.

### 📋 Path B — Ask

**Taken only when Step 1's triage found the brief sufficient.**


Task description: `<REFINED_TASK>`

**Resolve, don't ask: the repo.** `imps-paths.sh` already derives the working tree from
`git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and disambiguates it by remote. Take the repo from
`git remote get-url origin` and surface it for correction only if `<REFINED_TASK>` implies
a different target. A hand-typed answer here is what lands in the state file's `repo`, so
asking creates a value that can silently disagree with the checkout every other step acts
on. Don't ask which branch either: Phase 2 Step 7 always cuts a fresh dedicated branch off
the default branch — never the branch the operator happens to be standing on.

That leaves **exactly four questions, which is `AskUserQuestion`'s hard cap** — ask them in
a single call. Do not add a fifth; if something else needs settling, it belongs in Phase 1's
interrogation or in a prose follow-up after this call returns.

**Offer positions, not blanks.** `AskUserQuestion` is a multiple-choice tool with no
free-text field — an open prompt forces every operator through "Other". Derive 2–4 concrete
options per question from the scout recon and the brief, and let them correct one. Proposing
a wrong option is cheap and informative; a blank prompt is neither.

1. **What concrete output artifacts are expected?** Options drawn from what the brief
   implies — code changes on a branch, a Bash script, a GitHub Discussion post, docs. In
   discussion-seed mode the Workflow script posts a reply comment on the source discussion
   at finalize regardless of the answer here; this question is only for artifacts *beyond*
   that reply.
2. **What access will agents need — and does any task have to change live state?** Data
   sources, APIs, credentials, plus the mutation question explicitly. A "yes" is not
   cosmetic: the script's dispatch appends `Read-only. No file changes.` to every `query`
   task whose spec does not contain `MUTATIONS_ALLOWED`, so an unmarked live-ops task
   returns a confident diagnosis and no mutation, with every acceptance criterion unmet and
   the state file reporting success. Carry a "yes" into that task's spec verbatim.
3. **What must be true of the diff for this to be done — and which command proves it?**
   Not "how will you know this is done". Every answer becomes a Definition-of-Done line, and
   each line is later graded against the merged diff: a criterion no diff could confirm comes
   back `unverifiable` and proves nothing. Reject vague answers and show the upgrade — the
   pattern is in `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/brief-probes.md` under "Done, checkably".
4. **What constrains this?** Present both classes as distinct options, because they fail
   differently and only one of them is intuitive:
   - **Safety** — off-limits files or systems, no prod changes, no PR creation. These
     protect the operator from the run.
   - **Consistency** — what must hold identically across tasks written independently: exact
     field names, a shared function signature, an API or schema shape more than one task
     touches. These protect the run from itself, and they are the reason
     `## Global Constraints` exists — worktree-isolated imps cannot see each other, so an
     unstated invariant surfaces as two internally-consistent, mutually contradictory
     implementations that each pass their own gates.

   When a consistency answer names an invariant, **follow up in prose for its exact values**
   before writing GOAL.md. "Match the schema" is not a constraint; the spelled-out field
   names are. See Phase 2's authoring rules.

Wait for all answers before proceeding.

### 🔒 Step 7 — Settle (both paths)

Everything here runs whether Step 4 interrogated or Path B asked its four questions.

**This is the run's autonomy contract, and it is the whole reason the later phases can run
unattended.** Every routine gate that used to interrupt a run mid-flight is answered here
instead: how far the run goes, whether you review the plan, how personas publish, and what
happens to the learnings. After this step, the only things that can stop the run are
*failures* — a red gate, a conflict, a review that will not pass — never a request for
permission you could have granted up front.

Ask in **one `AskUserQuestion` call** (the cap is per call, so these do not compete with
Path B's four).

1. **Endstate** — `"Where should this run stop?"`
   - `Stop at a green PR` — raise it, drive it to green, hand it over. The conservative
     default and the only endstate needing no merge authorization.
   - `Merge the green PR` — same, then merge once checks pass and conflicts are clear.
   - `Merge and release` — same, then cut a release per this repo's own convention.
     Confirm the repo actually has one first; if not, say so and treat merge as the ceiling.

2. **Plan review** — `"Review the plan before the imps start?"`
   - `Show me the plan first` — `ExitPlanMode` runs as the approval gate.
   - `Only stop if the Head Imp objects` — dispatch on an APPROVE; stop and show you the
     plan on CHANGES_REQUESTED. The Head Imp reviews every plan either way, so this
     trades *your* review for *its* review, not for no review at all.

3. **Learnings** — `"What should happen to what this run learns?"`
   - `Save what it finds` — append every candidate; scope is auto-classified.
   - `Ask me at the end` — the old behaviour, one question at `final`.
   - `Save nothing` — close out silently.

Persist all three into the state file at Phase 2 Step 7 as `endstate`
(`"pr" | "merge" | "release"`), `plan_review` (`"ask" | "on_objection"`), and
`learnings_policy` (`"auto" | "ask" | "none"`). **Each defaults to its most conservative
value** when absent or unrecognized — `"pr"`, `"ask"`, `"ask"` — so a legacy or
hand-edited state file can never be read as consent to merge or to skip plan review.

**Merging is not implied by any other authorization in this run.** The Push & PR gate
authorizes pushing and opening; this answer, and only this answer, authorizes closing.
Even with it, merging a PR this session authored is self-approval and can be refused by
the permission classifier or by a standing deny rule on the merge tool — when that
happens, stop and hand over. Do not retry, and do not route around it with a raw ref push.

**Then check the tree can actually run its gates.** A lockfile with no installed
dependencies, a declared venv that isn't there — stop and tell the operator, and do not
guess an install command. This is cheap here and expensive later: an uninstalled dependency
surfaces downstream as a *red gate*, which sends `fixGate` off editing source to "fix" it.
The failure is already documented under **Concurrent runs against one repo** (a fresh
worktree has no `node_modules`, no venv, no build cache); this is the guard.

**Mark production-touching work now, while there is still a gate to fire on.** If any
answer above puts a task against a live production system, say so in that task's row and
spec in Phase 2, and surface it explicitly at the `ExitPlanMode` approval gate — that gate
is the last point this session controls before the Workflow script owns dispatch. The
Constraints section's "pause and confirm before that task runs" has no script-side
enforcement behind it, so plan approval is where the confirmation has to actually happen.

---

## 🗺️ Phase 2 — Plan

Using `<REFINED_TASK>` and the discovery answers, invoke native plan mode to produce
the authoritative decomposition. Under `opusplan`, plan mode routes to opus — so this
IS the "decompose on opus" requirement, with no duplicate planning pass.

**📚 Step 1 — Recall.** Learnings are already loaded — Phase 1 Step 1 read them from two sources
(both optional), and this step reuses what it found rather than re-reading:
- **User-scoped:** `$HOME/.claude/imps/learnings.md` — stack-agnostic rules that apply across all projects
- **Project-scoped:** `.claude/imps/learnings.md` in this working tree — rules specific to this project

Re-read them here only if Phase 1 was bypassed entirely (a resume that re-enters mid-run,
say). `Read` is a tool call, not Bash — it does not expand `~`, so resolve `$HOME`
yourself and pass the absolute form.

Reading either file is always safe. **Writing** them is not: the user-scoped file is
shared by every run on the machine, so appends go through
`scripts/imps-learnings-append.sh` (locked, append-only) and never through a
read-modify-write of the file. The project-scoped file lives in this run's own working
tree, so concurrent runs do not contend for it — but leave it uncommitted, or every
concurrent run's PR ends up touching the same unrelated file.

Read the `## Active rules` section from each file that exists. Merge both sets of rules and apply them to model assignment, task boundaries, and dependency detection throughout planning. Project-scoped rules take precedence over user-scoped rules on any conflict.

**✂️ Step 2 — Decompose.** Call **`EnterPlanMode`**. You are now the opus planner. Ground the plan in
reality. First read the dispatch value check in
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/task-sizing.md`. Reuse facts already verified in this
run. For each missing fact, name a bounded question before dispatching a `scout` for
mechanical recon or an `Explore` agent for a code-structure question. Do not launch a
second exploration pass over known answers. Read files directly when the plan must
quote or reason about their contents. Then:

- **Solo-task check, before decomposing:** if the work is genuinely one atomic unit — a
  single file/command/config change, or a task whose plan is already fully specified with
  nothing left to split — do not invent a multi-task table just to populate rows. Write a
  **single-row task table** and skip straight to Step 2. This is not a lighter path around
  the process, it's the same process with a smaller DAG: the plan is adversarially reviewed
  (Step 3) and OCR later reviews the merged diff; the one task still dispatches through the Workflow script
  exactly like any other stage, which is what offloads the actual work into an isolated
  worktree agent, out of this session's context; gates, the persona panel (when
  `--personas` is set), and the endstate PR all still run unchanged. The only thing skipped is manufacturing parallel work units
  where none exist — never hedge on whether to run the swarm at all over this; a one-task
  run is a first-class, expected outcome of planning, not a fallback to ask permission for.
- Otherwise, break the work into discrete, atomic tasks. Each task has one clearly-stated
  output and is independently completable.
  - **Sizing heuristic:** read
    `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/task-sizing.md` (shared with the Head Imp's own
    plan-review checklist — don't restate it here) and apply it to every task boundary.
    This run's own task-1/task-2 split, if you're reading this from inside one, is a live
    example of splitting by file ownership rather than by feature.
- For each task assign:
  - **Spec** — the operative instructions the imp needs to act without improvising:
    concrete inputs (repo/owner, file paths, exact commands), the expected output
    artifact, and any constraints. An imp receives ONLY its state-file entry, never this
    plan context; a plan file referenced in the run-level `task` string is never read by
    individual imps. Label-only imps improvise, and the observed failures are concrete:
    "couldn't find repo owner", "concluded nothing to publish", unauthorized GitHub
    issues filed as the deliverable.

    **Write the full spec into GOAL.md's `## Task specs` section and put a pointer in the
    state file** — not the spec itself:

    ```
    MANDATORY FIRST ACTION: Read <GOAL_PATH> section "### T3"; if unreadable, return failed.
    ```

    Substitute the resolved absolute `$GOAL_PATH` — an imp's `Read` tool will not expand
    `~` or `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` later. The pointer is the rule, not one of two options:
    the state file does not reach the script as a file read. `readState()` is an *agent*
    asked to re-emit the JSON through a schema, so a long embedded spec can arrive
    truncated — observed as an imp receiving only the first line of a multi-KB spec and
    improvising the rest — while the integrity guard, which checks task count and phase,
    passes. GOAL.md is read by each imp with its own tools, losslessly, outside that path.

    A spec short enough to be obviously intact at a glance (a sentence or two) may travel
    inline. Anything longer goes in GOAL.md with a pointer.
    For a bug, regression, flake, performance problem, or unexplained failing gate, the spec
    must also point to `references/diagnosis-loop.md` using the current resolved absolute
    `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` value — substitute it before writing the durable task spec; an
    imp's Read tool will not expand that token later. Include the known failing command when
    one exists. If none exists, constructing and running that red-capable command is the
    task's first deliverable — never hand an imp a symptom plus permission to theorize.
  - **Model** — assign by reasoning complexity (see
    [Model selection reference](#model-selection-reference)). Always set `model:` explicitly.
  - **Type** — `code` (file changes, worktree-isolated) · `query` (read-only by default; add `MUTATIONS_ALLOWED` to the task spec to authorize live mutations — e.g. SSH restarts, API state changes, config edits) ·
    `publish` (GitHub artifacts; use `gh api graphql` for Discussions, not REST)
  - **Depends-on** — prerequisite task IDs, or `—` if independent. A worktree-isolated
    task's checkout is cut from the remote default branch HEAD at spawn time, not from
    a not-yet-merged dependency's branch — if a task's spec needs its dependency's
    changes, say so explicitly in the spec (e.g. "assume task #N is already merged" or
    instruct a `git merge origin/<default>` first).

**📝 Step 3 — Draft.** Write **`GOAL.md`** to an absolute path under `~/.claude/imps/runs/` — not
the repo root, so the write never prompts for project-directory access. Derive the slug,
ensure the directory exists, and resolve+echo the absolute path — `Write` is a tool call,
not Bash, and does not expand `~`:
```sh
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
mkdir -p "$RUNS_DIR"
echo "$GOAL_PATH"
```
Pass the echoed `$GOAL_PATH` value as `Write`'s `file_path` — never the `~/...` form.
Step 6 re-derives the same `SLUG` (and its own absolute `STATE_PATH`) independently (same
one-liner) — shell state doesn't carry across tool calls. Write with this structure:

```markdown
# GOAL — <REFINED_TASK (one line)>

## Original request
<the operator's own words, verbatim — the raw $ARGUMENTS, the collected answer, or the
discussion body. Never a paraphrase; this section exists to be checked against.>

## Definition of Done
- [ ] <acceptance criterion 1>
- [ ] <acceptance criterion 2 — one line each from discovery>
- [ ] Gates green (build · lint · test · type — per GATE_CMDS)
- [ ] Plan adversarially reviewed (codex, else Head Imp); OCR reviewed the merged diff; all blocker/major findings addressed
- [ ] No merge conflicts with the default branch

## Global Constraints
- <constraint 1 — a rule EVERY task must satisfy, with its exact values written out>
- <constraint 2>
(_None._ if there are none — never leave this section empty)

## Task table
 #  Task                                      Model   Type     Depends On
 1  <label>                                   haiku   query    —
 2  ...
(a solo run legitimately stops at row 1 — see Phase 2 Step 2's solo-task check; don't pad
with synthetic tasks to make the table look bigger)

## Task specs

### T1 — <label>
<the full operative spec: concrete inputs, repo/owner, absolute file paths, exact
commands, the expected output artifact, and any task-local constraints. This is what the
imp actually executes; the state file only points here.>

### T2 — <label>
...

## Status
Planned — handing to the Workflow script.

## Decision trail
_None._

## Parked findings
_None._
```

`## Task specs` holds one `### T<N>` subsection per task, in task-table order, and is what
every task's state-file pointer resolves to. It is written at plan time and not touched
afterwards — the script's own GOAL.md writes target Status, the DoD boxes, Decision trail,
and Parked findings only.

**`- [ ]` checkboxes appear ONLY under `## Definition of Done`.** Original request,
Global Constraints, Task specs, Decision trail, and Parked findings are checkbox-free — a stray checkbox anywhere else
in GOAL.md is read as a phantom task. Each renders the literal `_None._` when it has no
content, so an empty section is distinguishable from a section that was never written.

**Authoring `## Global Constraints`** — this is where discovery Q5 ("any constraints?")
lands durably. It exists because independent worktree-isolated imps cannot see each
other: a rule that has to hold across tasks has nowhere else to live, and when it lives
only in this planning context, imps produce mutually contradictory output (two different
import recipes for the same API; runtime env vars silently dropped by one task and
required by another). The script delivers this section to every agent that writes or
reviews code as a pointer — `Read <GOAL_PATH> section "Global Constraints"` — never as
pasted text, so it must be readable standalone.

- **Write exact values verbatim, never summarized.** "Use the field names in the schema"
  is not a constraint; "the state fields are `parked_findings`, `wontfix_rulings`,
  `verdicts_pending` — spelled exactly, in all three files" is.
- **Except where a gate command already enforces the rule — then name the command, never
  its threshold.** "No change under `dist/` beyond what `bash build/dist-lint.sh
  --check-frozen-sources` accepts" is durable; "exactly two exceptions are permitted under
  `dist/`" is a copy of the gate's logic that will drift from it. When it drifts, no imp
  can close the finding: the divergence is in the governing text, not in the code, so
  every fix round correctly re-flags it and correctly fails to fix it. One run's only
  surviving blocker was exactly this — a constraint saying "two" against a gate correctly
  enforcing three.
- **Only constraints a reviewer could return a verdict against from a diff.** If nothing
  in a diff could ever falsify it, it is background, not a constraint. Aspirations
  ("keep it clean", "be careful with the merge logic") belong nowhere.
- **Not the DoD.** A DoD criterion is true *once*, gets ticked, and is verified by the
  script's `dodCoverage` pass. A constraint is true of *every* task, is never ticked, and
  is verified by whoever reviews any task's diff. If you catch yourself writing a
  checkbox, it was a DoD line.

**`## Decision trail`** is a durable summary owned by the Workflow finalizer. Leave its
body as `_None._` during planning. At the end of a run, the finalizer replaces it with
plain bullets for nontrivial pivots only: Head Imp plan amendments, code-review fix
rounds and any overridden or skipped review, conflicts resolved,
skipped gates or tasks, and advisory-check failures. It is not a chronological activity
log and must not duplicate routine task completions or the audit JSONL event.

**`## Parked findings`** is a placeholder you write as `_None._` and then leave alone —
after handover it belongs to the script, which replaces its body with the adjudicator's
rulings (see Phase 4's `unresolved_findings`). Place it last, after Decision trail.

Discussion-seed mode: add `- [ ] Outcome comment posted to the source Discussion` to
the Definition of Done — the script fulfills this at finalize; it is not a dispatched
task, and it stays unchecked if the run aborts before finalize (note that in Status
rather than treating it as a bug).
Add `- [ ] CI green on the PR` **only if this run will open a PR** (the endstate PR is
the default for runs that produce code changes; the script adds this line itself when
a PR opens if you omitted it). Omit it for query/publish-only runs, or it stays
permanently unresolvable.
Add `- [ ] Persona panel reviewed; all blocker/major findings addressed` to the
Definition of Done **only when `--personas` (`PERSONA_PANEL` true) was passed** — that is
the only run where a panel executes. On a default run the panel never runs, so the box
would stay permanently unchecked; the Head Imp line above is the review criterion instead.

This file is the `/compact`-durable human-readable spine. It lives outside the project
on purpose. The JSON state file (Step 6) is the **authoritative** task table — the
Workflow script dispatches from it, not from GOAL.md. If you hand-edit GOAL.md's task
table after approval, mirror the change into the state file (or re-run planning) or it
will not take effect. After handover, GOAL.md belongs to the script — it ticks the boxes
and keeps Status current.

**😈 Step 4 — Critique (mandatory).**
Before calling `ExitPlanMode`, get an adversarial verdict on the plan — **tier 1 (codex)
first, the Head Imp only if codex is unavailable** (see
[Plan review](#plan-review--cross-lineage-first-head-imp-as-fallback) above). Either way
the reviewer argues AGAINST the plan — wrong boundaries, mis-routed models, missing deps,
gaps in the DoD. Fix what the critique exposes before proceeding.

For tier 1, GOAL.md must be **uncommitted in the working tree** so a working-tree scope
sees it; if it has already been committed, review it with `--scope branch --base
<default>` instead of leaving codex with an empty diff and no findings — an empty scope
is a failed review, not an approval. For tier 2, pass the **absolute path** of `GOAL.md`
— the `$GOAL_PATH` value echoed in Step 2, e.g. `/Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.md`,
never the `~/...` form — and the Head Imp Reads it itself.

**Record which tier produced the verdict** in the decision trail. A tier-2 verdict is
same-lineage, and an operator reading the trail later needs to know the plan was graded
by a sibling of its author.

Before sending, read the composed prompt back against
[Never pre-judge a reviewer's findings inside its own prompt](#never-pre-judge-a-reviewers-findings-inside-its-own-prompt)
and delete anything that pre-clears a finding, narrows the mandate, or supplies the
verdict. This applies to tier 1's focus text exactly as it does to the Head Imp's prompt:
the focus text may redirect the reviewer's *subject* from Markdown to the plan, and may
not touch its conclusion. There is no script-side enforcement of this — the check happens
here, at the moment you write the string, or not at all.

**Then get a second verdict on what you changed.** If you fixed any blocker or major
finding, re-review before Step 5 and wait for a fresh VERDICT. An approval of the
*unfixed* plan is not an approval of the fixed one, and round-1 fixes have twice
introduced round-2 bugs — once a "make this executable" fix that turned out to be
platform-unsound on the actual dev machine. On tier 2 this is cheap — `SendMessage` the
same `agentId` with the delta, since the Head Imp already holds its own findings. On tier
1 it is a full fresh review; pay it rather than switching tiers mid-plan. Minor and nit
findings do not require a re-verdict.

**✅ Step 5 — Approve.** What happens here is the `plan_review` answer from Phase 1 Step 7:

- **`"ask"` (the default)** — call **`ExitPlanMode`**. This IS the approval gate.
- **`"on_objection"`** — the operator delegated plan review to the adversarial reviewer. On a Step 4
  verdict of `APPROVE`, skip `ExitPlanMode` and proceed to Step 6; on
  `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, call `ExitPlanMode` anyway and show them the findings. Every plan
  is still adversarially reviewed — this trades *their* review for the reviewer's, not
  for none.

**Two things override `"on_objection"` and always stop for the operator:** a
production-touching task (see Phase 1 Step 7), and a plan whose adversarial verdict was
reached only after you applied fixes and re-verdicted. In both cases call `ExitPlanMode`
regardless of the policy, and say which of the two triggered it. This is the last point
this session controls before the Workflow script owns dispatch.

If the user requests changes, stay in plan mode and revise `GOAL.md`, then re-review it —
resuming the same Head Imp with the delta on tier 2, or a fresh tier-1 run — rather than
proceeding on the stale verdict; when approved, proceed.

**⏱️ Step 6 — Pace.** Set `poll_interval_seconds: 300` (5-minute default — no user prompt needed).

**🌿 Step 7 — Cut.** Cut the run's dedicated working branch, then write the durable state file
**now** — this is your last write to it; from Phase 3 onward it belongs to the
Workflow script. **Never write the branch you happen to be on into the state file** — that
includes the default branch, and doing so is exactly how a run ends up committing every
task's work straight onto `master`. Always cut a fresh branch off a clean fetch of the
default branch, the same way `commands/issue-mode.md` Phase 1 cuts its holding branch:

```sh
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
mkdir -p "$RUNS_DIR"
[ -z "$(git status --porcelain)" ] || { echo "working tree not clean — stopping" >&2; git status --short; exit 1; }
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | sed -n '/HEAD branch/s/.*: //p')
RUN_BRANCH="imps/${SLUG}-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" && git checkout -b "$RUN_BRANCH" "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
echo "$STATE_PATH"; echo "$RUN_BRANCH"
```

**The clean-tree check is not a formality.** Uncommitted changes here are either carried
onto the run branch and attributed to imps that never wrote them, or they belong to
someone else: a shared checkout can be in active use by an unrelated concurrent session,
which has been observed mid-run with HEAD on a foreign branch carrying a fresh commit. If
it trips, show the operator `git status --short` and let them decide — never stash (the
stash stack is shared across every worktree) and never discard.

`Write` the JSON below to the echoed `$STATE_PATH` (its `file_path`, not the `~/...`

`verdicts_pending`, `parked_findings`, `wontfix_rulings`, `fix_rounds_done`,
and `fix_cycles` are new in **schema 4** (persona-panel adjudication) —
additive only, in the same style as schema 3 below: nothing existing removed or
repurposed, none of them required, so a hand-written schema-3 file still loads. (Schema 4
also added four fail-soft breadcrumb fields not listed above — `heartbeat_clock_error`,
`dispatch_clock_error`, `parked_findings_write_error`, and `adjudication_error` — each
`null` unless the thing it names just failed. The first three exist only to reach the
audit trail and carry no behavior of their own. **`adjudication_error` is different and is
operator-facing:** it records that the adjudicator never returned a ruling, it travels in
the blocked result's `detail`, and the `override findings:` path reads it to decide that
the findings still awaiting a ruling are the ones being overridden — so an override on
that path records them explicitly instead of silently no-opping. All four clear on
recovery rather than latching, so a later healthy cycle is not reported as degraded.)
All six of the named fields are written by the script during the
persona panel and fix loop; you never write them at plan time beyond the empty values
above. `verdicts_pending` holds panel output that is *not yet complete* — `verdicts`
staying `null` is the script's "the panel has not finished, run it again" signal, so
partial output must never be promoted into it. `parked_findings` and `wontfix_rulings`
carry the adjudicator's rulings and each fix round's declined findings. `fix_cycles`
bounds the `retry findings` verb (refused past two granted cycles); `fix_rounds_done` is
a record of how many fix rounds the most recently completed cycle ran (surfaced in the
result, not itself a bound) — each cycle's own fix loop always restarts counting from
round 0, it does not resume a prior cycle's round count. See Phase 4's `unresolved_findings` entry for
what an operator does with them.

`endstate`, `plan_review` and `learnings_policy` are the Phase 1 Step 7 autonomy contract,
and each falls back to its most conservative value when absent or unrecognized — a policy
that cannot be read is never consent.

- `endstate` — `"pr"` (stop at a green PR), `"merge"`, or `"release"`. The **only** thing
  authorizing Phase 5 to close the PR; defaults to `"pr"`.
- `plan_review` — `"ask"` (default) or `"on_objection"`. Read by Phase 2 Step 5, in this
  session, not by the script.
- `learnings_policy` — `"ask"` (default), `"auto"`, or `"none"`. Read by the script at
  finalize: `auto` appends every candidate and closes the run out in the same invocation,
  `none` discards them and does the same, `ask` returns `final` for the Phase 5 gate.

`gate_commands`, `learnings_saved`, `operator_decision`, and `last_result` are new in
schema 3 (the Workflow-script rewrite) — additive only, nothing existing was removed or
repurposed. `gate_commands` persists the once-per-run gate-command discovery result so it
survives across the fresh invocations described in Phase 3/4 (a real state-file field
replaces what used to live only in the wrangler's own session memory for the run's
duration). `operator_decision` carries the pending decision string (the same resume-verb
vocabulary as before) from Phase 4 into the next fresh invocation. `last_result` is the
full result object the script returned last time (verbatim) — a fresh invocation reads
`last_result.status` alongside `operator_decision` to know exactly what to resume into,
rather than re-deriving routing state from `phase`/`segment` alone. `learnings_saved`
guards the learnings-append step exactly like `pr`/`verdicts`/`discussion_comment_url`
guard their own side effects. A legacy schema-2 file (missing these four fields) is
treated as having them all `null` — the script's own dispatch/gate/learnings logic
re-derives
whatever it needs rather than assuming they exist.

Discussion-seed mode: set `source_discussion` to
`{ "owner": "...", "repo": "...", "number": <int>, "id": "<GraphQL node ID>", "url": "<discussion URL>" }`
(fields fetched in `references/discussion-mode.md` step 2). Every other mode leaves it
`null`. Imps are unnamed — each is identified by a themed Nerd Font glyph derived from
its task ID (see the dispatch banner), so the state file carries no `name` field.

Then proceed immediately to Phase 3 — no `/clear` handoff is needed: every Workflow
invocation is fresh by construction (see Phase 4's design note), so dispatch never
inherits this planning window regardless.

## 🔨 Phase 3 — Build

The imps do the work. Phase 3 hands the approved plan to the Workflow script, which
dispatches the task DAG as staged `agent()` calls — each code task in its own isolated
worktree — and returns when it needs a decision. Phases 3, 4 and 5 are all the *same*
script: one body of real control flow spanning git preflight, dispatch, merge, gates, the
OCR diff review, the PR, the persona panel and finalize. They are separate phases here
because they are separate things happening, not separate programs.

**These phase names are not the script's `phase()` labels, and the two are not meant to
match.** The script declares `Preflight · Dispatch · Integrate · Publish · Finalize` in its
`meta` — those are the harness's own progress groupings, rendered by `/workflows`, and they
group `agent()` calls rather than operator-facing stages. Read across:

| This command | Script `phase()` | Why they differ |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Guard, Phases 1–2 | — | Runs in this session; the script has not started |
| 🔨 3 Build | `Preflight`, `Dispatch` | Preflight also covers the state read, its integrity check, and the OCR preflight |
| 🔗 4 Consolidate | `Integrate` | One-to-one: merge, gates, review, coverage |
| 🚢 5 PR | `Publish`, `Finalize` | Publish covers open/panel/green/close; Finalize is Step 5, Land |

Do not "fix" the mismatch by renaming either side. The script's labels describe where an
`agent()` call runs; these phases describe what the run is doing and where the operator
fits. Collapsing them would make one of the two wrong.

**This command has a hard dependency on the `Workflow` tool — there is no prose
fallback.** If `Workflow` is unavailable in this session, tell the user plainly
(`/imps:imps` requires it) and stop; do not attempt to execute the old subagent-dispatch
protocol inline.

**📦 Step 1 — Sync.** Workflow scripts only load from a user's own
`~/.claude/workflows/*.js` — a plugin cannot ship one that runs directly. Each run,
re-sync the bundled copy so it always matches the installed plugin version.

The destination is **content-addressed** — `imps-run-<sha8>.js`, keyed to the bundled
script's own hash — because that path is shared by every run on the machine. Under a
single fixed name, a run starting after a plugin update overwrites the script that a
run already in flight is about to resume into. Hashing means same version → same file
(the copy is byte-identical, so it stays a no-op), different version → different file,
and nothing is ever swapped underneath a live run. Copies are never garbage-collected:
each is ~130KB, and deleting one that some other run still resumes into would break the
only thing the state file is for.

**The `Workflow` tool call below is not Bash — it does not expand `~`,** so resolve and
echo the absolute paths here first, and pass those literal echoed values (never the
`~/...` form) into Step 2:

```bash
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
mkdir -p ~/.claude/workflows "$RUNS_DIR"
SRC="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-run.workflow.js"
SHA=$(shasum -a 256 "$SRC" 2>/dev/null || sha256sum "$SRC" 2>/dev/null \
      || python3 -c 'import hashlib,sys;print(hashlib.sha256(open(sys.argv[1],"rb").read()).hexdigest())' "$SRC")
SHA=$(printf '%s' "$SHA" | tr -d '\n' | cut -c1-8)
[ ${#SHA} -eq 8 ] || { echo "could not hash $SRC" >&2; exit 1; }
WORKFLOW_DEST="$HOME/.claude/workflows/imps-run-${SHA}.js"
cp "$SRC" "$WORKFLOW_DEST" || { echo "could not sync $SRC -> $WORKFLOW_DEST" >&2; exit 1; }
cmp -s "$SRC" "$WORKFLOW_DEST" || { echo "synced copy differs from $SRC" >&2; exit 1; }
echo "$WORKFLOW_DEST"; echo "$STATE_PATH"; echo "$GOAL_PATH"
```

The copy is guarded as tightly as the hash: an unguarded `cp` failure still prints a
perfectly plausible destination path, and Step 2 then invokes a script that isn't there.

**`~/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js` — the old fixed name — is dead.** Content-addressing
moved the destination to `imps-run-<sha8>.js`, so nothing loads the unsuffixed file or any
`.bak` beside it, and edits made there have no effect on any run. Older notes that say to
patch environment fixes into that path are stale; those fixes belong upstream in
`scripts/imps-run.workflow.js`. Unlike the content-addressed copies — which are never
collected, because deleting one that a paused run resumes into destroys the only thing its
state file is for — the legacy fixed-name files are safe to delete.

Record which copy this run invoked, so a later resume can tell the operator the plugin
version moved under them (content-addressing stops the script being swapped mid-run, but
leaves no trace that a different one is now in play):

```bash
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
jq --arg p "$WORKFLOW_DEST" '.workflow_script = $p' "$STATE_PATH" > "${TMP_PREFIX}-state.json" \
  && mv "${TMP_PREFIX}-state.json" "$STATE_PATH"
```

`workflow_script` is additive and unread by the script — the state schema is
`additionalProperties: true`, so an older file without it loads unchanged.

**🦇 Step 2 — Dispatch.** Every invocation is a **fresh** `Workflow` call — never
`resumeFromRunId` (see the design note at the end of this file for why). The script's own
first step reads the state file and decides what's already done; there is nothing for the
harness's own resume mechanism to add, and relying on it would risk silently re-triggering
side effects the script itself must guard against instead.

```
Workflow({
  scriptPath: "<the echoed $WORKFLOW_DEST value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/workflows/imps-run-1a2b3c4d.js>",
  args: {
    pluginRoot: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}",
    stateFilePath: "<the echoed $STATE_PATH value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json>",
    goalFilePath: "<the echoed $GOAL_PATH value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md>",
    personaPanel: <PERSONA_PANEL — the boolean derived in "Runtime flags"; true only if --personas was passed, else false>,
    personaBriefPaths: {
      "solution-architect": { path: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/solution-architect.md", model: "opus" },
      "grumpy-engineer": { path: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/grumpy-engineer.md", model: "opus" },
      "sre": { path: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/sre.md", model: "opus" },
      "business-analyst": { path: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/business-analyst.md", model: "opus" },
      "ux-designer": { path: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/ux-designer.md", model: "sonnet", requires: ["browser-surface"] }
    }
  }
})
```

Each roster entry carries its own dispatch `model` and, where relevant, `requires` — the
capability tags the surface-detection skip below filters on. A future persona is handled
by adding a roster entry (with whatever `model`/`requires` it needs), never by adding a new
hardcoded slug check to the Workflow script.

**`personaPanel` gates whether the panel runs at all.** It is `false` by default (no
`--personas` flag): the script skips the entire panel + fix-loop + adjudication block and
finalizes on the adversarial plan review and OCR diff review, which is the intended default for
repos whose PRs already draw persona reviews from a GitHub-side automation. Pass the
`PERSONA_PANEL` boolean derived in **Runtime flags**. `personaBriefPaths` is always
supplied regardless — the script only reads it when `personaPanel` is `true`, so there is
nothing to conditionalize in the roster below.

`personaBriefPaths` always lists all five briefs. Before the initial panel call only, a
cheap `model: 'haiku'` classifier reads `git diff --name-only origin/<default>..HEAD` and
decides — by file role/location, not bare extension, since a plain `.js`/`.ts` file can
be the browser surface itself (a React or Angular component, a client route) — whether
any changed path is browser-renderable, rather than forcing a browser review or
attempting an unattended Chrome-MCP session on every run. When no such surface is found,
the panel is filtered to the slugs whose roster entry does NOT list `"browser-surface"` in
`requires` (`Object.entries(args.personaBriefPaths).filter(([, b]) => !(b.requires ||
[]).includes('browser-surface'))`), never a hardcoded `!== 'ux-designer'` check, so a
future persona (browser or non-browser) is handled by its own roster entry instead of by
editing this filter — and the run's findings record exactly `"ux-designer skipped — no
browser-renderable surface: <reason>"` with a `"SKIPPED"` verdict (a third value alongside
`APPROVE`/`CHANGES_REQUESTED`, and the dissenter fix-loop never re-reviews it). Any classification
error, or a detected surface, runs all five personas — the script fails open toward
running ux-designer rather than silently dropping it, and the skip applies to this initial
call only, not the fix-loop re-review pass.

**📡 Step 3 — Hand off.** Print the dispatch banner and stop; you'll be notified. `Workflow` runs in
the background — this turn ends here, not after the run finishes.

```bash
SLUG=$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh" --slug) ; python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dispatch-banner.py" "$SLUG"
```

Progress between results is visible in the state file — the script heartbeats
`last_heartbeat` and `tasks_done` as tasks complete, same fields as before, for the
banner's `progress:` hint to read. Whether a single hung (non-erroring) `agent()` call has
a platform-level timeout is **not verified** — this is a residual, carried-over risk, not
one this rewrite claims to have solved (today's design also had no automated hang
detector for this case, only a human-visible heartbeat staleness signal).

---

## 🔗 Phase 4 — Consolidate

The imps' branches become one reviewed, green branch. It ends at
`awaiting_authorization` — everything after that belongs to Phase 5.

The script runs these in order; you see them only through the `status` it returns, so they
are named here to make a blocked result legible rather than because you drive them:

| Step | What happens | Blocks as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔀 **1 — Merge** | imp branches onto the run branch, default branch synced in | `merge_conflict`, `branch_mismatch` |
| 🚦 **2 — Gate** | build · lint · test · type, with a fix round per failure | `gate_red` |
| 🔬 **3 — Review** | OCR on the merged diff, up to 3 fix rounds | `code_review_red`, `code_review_unavailable`, `uncommitted_changes` |
| 📊 **4 — Cover** | each functional DoD criterion graded against the diff | never blocks; degrades to a warning |
| 🔑 **5 — Authorize** | publish decision, derived from `endstate` | returns `awaiting_authorization` |

Gates run **before** review deliberately: a review-driven fix re-runs every gate and is
then sent to a fresh OCR run, so the review never sees a tree the gates would reject.

The relay mechanism described here is shared with Phase 5; it is documented once, in this
phase, because this is where the first result arrives.

Each phase of the script ends in exactly one returned `status`, arriving as a
`<task-notification>` when the background `Workflow` run reaches that point. There is no
`SendMessage`/`agentId` to resume — an operator decision is **persisted into the state
file**, then the script is **re-invoked fresh** (Phase 3 Steps 1–3 again, verbatim). The
script's own opening step reads the state file and skips whatever it says is already
done; this is how "resume" works throughout, deliberately not via `resumeFromRunId` (see
the design note at the end of this file).

To persist a decision, patch the state file's `operator_decision` field before
re-invoking (a single preapprovable command, not a hand-rolled multi-line edit):

```bash
eval "$("${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-paths.sh")"
jq --arg d '<the decision string, same vocabulary as today — see below>' \
  '.operator_decision = $d' "$STATE_PATH" > "${TMP_PREFIX}-state.json" \
  && mv "${TMP_PREFIX}-state.json" "$STATE_PATH"
```

The temporary file is `$TMP_PREFIX`-scoped, not a fixed `$TMPDIR/imps-state.json`: a
fixed name is shared by every run on the machine, and this one is renamed *over* a state
file — so a collision here does not corrupt a temp file, it writes one run's decision
into another run's state.

The decision vocabulary is almost unchanged from before: `resolved, continue` ·
`retry <gate>: <guidance>` · `skip <gate>` · `reconciled, continue` ·
`retry tasks #N,#M: <guidance>` · `skip tasks #N,#M` · `integrate partial` ·
`retry findings` · `override findings: <rationale>` ·
`override code review: <rationale>` · `skip code review: <rationale>` ·
`PR: yes` · `PR: no` · `learnings: <json|none>` · `abort` — the
delivery mechanism changed (from a `SendMessage` to a spawned subagent, to a state-file
field read by a fresh script invocation), and one verb is dropped: `wait <hours>` existed
to extend `max_dispatch_hours`'s manual poll-loop timeout, which no longer exists (see
the design note) — there is no `dispatch_timeout` blocked reason for it to resume from
either. `integrate partial` is still supported: it confirms every currently-unresolved
task failure as an accepted omission (the same effect as naming them all in
`skip tasks`), so re-dispatch doesn't re-block on the same failures.

Two verbs are new, and both resume only from an `unresolved_findings` block (below):

- **`retry findings`** — give the findings another capped fix cycle. The script reseeds
  the panel from `verdicts_pending` rather than re-running the five personas (which would
  post five more GitHub reviews in `live` mode and discard the existing `posted` flags and
  the SKIPPED entry), resets the round counter, and runs up to three more fix rounds
  followed by a fresh adjudication. Bounded at **two cycles** by `fix_cycles`, where the
  initial panel run is cycle 1: exactly **one** `retry findings` is granted (it makes
  cycle 2), and the **second** `retry findings` is refused — only `override findings:` or
  `abort` remain after that. It takes no guidance argument — anything after the verb is
  ignored.
- **`override findings: <rationale>`** — accept the load-bearing findings as they stand
  and finalize anyway. Every `load-bearing` ruling is rewritten to `operator-overridden`
  with your rationale recorded on it, `verdicts_pending` is promoted to `verdicts`, and
  the run proceeds to finalize. The rationale is not decoration: it is the only record
  that a blocking finding was overruled rather than fixed, and it survives into GOAL.md's
  `## Parked findings` section after the state file is deleted. Write one.

**The anti-pre-judging rule applies to every guidance string you compose here** (see
[Never pre-judge a reviewer's findings inside its own prompt](#never-pre-judge-a-reviewers-findings-inside-its-own-prompt)).
`retry <gate>: <guidance>`, `retry tasks #N: <guidance>`, and `retry findings`'s fix
rounds all put your text in front of an agent that will re-review the result. Guidance
says *what to fix and how it failed*; it does not say what the reviewer should conclude —
"this is fine now", "don't flag the sizing again", "just get it to APPROVE" are
pre-judgments, not guidance. If you want a finding overruled, `override findings:` is the
verb that does it **on the record**; `skip <gate>` and `skip tasks #N` are the equivalents
at the other gates. All three leave a trace an operator can read afterwards. Steering the
prompt leaves none.

**If a result never arrives** (session lost, `/clear`, or the run legitimately needs
picking up later): do nothing special here — the **Guard: resume check** at the top of
this command already handles it. Re-running `/imps:imps` reads the state file's `phase`
and `segment`, and Phase 3 re-syncs and re-invokes the script fresh; its own opening step
reconciles against the state file and git ground truth exactly as the old `resume`-mode
wrangler did (worktree branches, GOAL.md checkboxes, published artifacts) — see the
design note for what the script must implement to preserve this.

**`blocked` results** — surface the problem, agree the next step with the user, persist
the decision, re-invoke:
- `state_read_mismatch` — readState()'s task count/phase disagree with a raw `jq` check
  of the state file (the readState() mismapping failure mode, #87) — everything else in
  `state`, including `operator_decision` itself, is untrustworthy this invocation, so the
  script refuses to route on it. Inspect the raw file (`jq . <state file>`); if it looks
  fine, this was likely a one-off read blip — persist `resolved, continue` to retry. If
  the file itself is actually garbled, fix it by hand or persist `abort`.
- `dispatch_failed` — preflight rebase conflict or imp-dispatch error. The user fixes
  the tree (or decides); persist `resolved, continue` or `abort`.
- `imps_failed` — failed tasks block the DoD. Ask the user (retry with guidance / skip
  those tasks / integrate without any of the unresolved ones / abort) and persist
  `retry tasks #N: ...`, `skip tasks #N`, `integrate partial`, or `abort`.
- `merge_conflict` — the conflict is live in the shared working tree. List the branch +
  files; let the user resolve (or resolve trivial conflicts yourself), then persist
  `resolved, continue`.
- `gate_red` — surface the gate name + log tail; agree retry guidance, skip, or abort.
- `uncommitted_changes` — the working tree had uncommitted work at a point where
  everything downstream reads commits: the code review reads `MERGE_BASE..HEAD`,
  `diff_stat` and `dod_coverage` read `origin/<default>..HEAD`, and `git push` sends
  commits. Proceeding would review around the change and then drop it, with every gate
  still green. `detail.porcelain` names the files and `detail.where` says which point
  tripped. Establish whose the changes are first — a shared checkout can be in use by an
  unrelated concurrent session — then either commit them or, if they are not this run's,
  hand them back to their owner. Never stash: the stash stack is shared across every
  worktree on the machine. Persist `resolved, continue` once the tree is clean.
- `code_review_red` — OCR reviewed the merged diff, returned CHANGES_REQUESTED, and three
  fix rounds did not clear it. `detail.findings` carries what survived, with the model and
  provider that produced them. Agree a path: fix the findings and persist
  `resolved, continue`, or accept them on the record with
  `override code review: <rationale>`. Treat a *clean* pass on a large diff with less
  confidence than it invites — repeated OCR runs over one large diff have produced
  different finding sets each time, so absence of a finding on one pass is not evidence it
  was addressed, only that it wasn't sampled.
- `code_review_unavailable` — the review could not run *at all*: a setup/endpoint failure,
  or a diff too large for the pinned model to finish. This is not a red verdict, it is no
  verdict, and it can arrive from the pre-dispatch preflight as well as from the review
  itself. Fix the cause and persist `resolved, continue`, or — when the review genuinely
  cannot complete for this diff — persist `skip code review: <rationale>`. That verb
  records the review as *never run*, distinct from `override code review:`, which accepts
  one that ran and returned findings. Both reach the PR body and the audit trail; neither
  is ever rendered as an approval.
- `branch_mismatch` — reconcile branch state with the user, then persist
  `reconciled, continue`. Don't take an agent's self-reported `id` or `branch` at face
  value here — agents can collide on the same self-reported id or report the base
  branch instead of their real one. Cross-check against the state file's own task
  table (the authoritative source for task identity) and `git branch --list` / `git
  worktree list` for the actual branch names.
- `unresolved_findings` — the persona panel's fix loop hit its 3-round cap with findings
  still standing, an opus adjudicator ruled on each survivor, and at least one ruling came
  back `load-bearing`. This is the only blocked reason that arrives *after* the PR exists.
  The result's `detail` carries the rulings; `parked_findings` and `wontfix_rulings` are
  also in the state file and in the final result object. Surface every `load-bearing`
  finding with its rationale, then agree one of: `retry findings` (another capped fix
  cycle — refused after two), `override findings: <rationale>` (accept them and finalize,
  on the record), or `abort`. **Do not fix them silently in this session** — that is the
  self-review pattern the disclosure below exists for.

  Those three strings are matched **verbatim and case-sensitively** — unlike the task and
  gate verbs, which are case-insensitive. Persist exactly `retry findings`,
  `override findings: <rationale>` (colon included), or `abort`. Anything else, including an
  empty decision, makes the script re-emit the same blocked result with a `detail.note`
  naming the vocabulary; nothing is re-run, so just persist a valid verb and re-invoke.

  A **ruling** is the adjudicator's verdict on one surviving finding, and it is one of
  exactly four values:
  - `load-bearing` — the finding blocks. The adjudicator had to anchor it to at least one
    of: a verbatim-quoted criterion under GOAL.md's `## Definition of Done`; a named
    concrete breaking input, data-loss path, or security defect reachable in the merged
    diff; or a verbatim-quoted constraint under GOAL.md's `## Global Constraints`. A
    ruling with none of the three anchors cannot be load-bearing, so a `load-bearing`
    ruling that quotes neither a DoD criterion nor a Global Constraint and names no
    breaking input is a malformed ruling, not a stricter one — treat it as suspect and
    read the finding yourself. A ruling that DOES quote a Global Constraint is fully
    anchored on that basis alone; do not second-guess it just because it lacks a DoD
    criterion or a named breaking input too — the constraint anchor stands on its own.
  - `parked-contestable` — reviewed, judged non-blocking, and the adjudicator's reasoning
    is the thing you might disagree with. This is the ruling to re-read: a finding raised
    by two or more distinct personas defaults to `load-bearing`, so parking one of those
    obliges the adjudicator to state which DoD criterion survives it.
  - `parked-deferred` — real, non-blocking here, and worth doing later. It is not an
    argument to reopen; it is a follow-up to file.
  - `operator-overridden` — was `load-bearing` until you issued `override findings:`. The
    rationale stored on it is yours, not the adjudicator's.

  All four are written to GOAL.md's `## Parked findings` section except `load-bearing`,
  which blocks instead. "Parked" always means *reviewed and ruled on* — it never means a
  persona that was never run. A `SKIPPED` ux-designer is an unreviewed lens, not a parked
  finding; say so distinctly when you summarise.

If the user chooses abort at any gate, persist `abort` and re-invoke. The script posts
any Discussion abort notice itself before returning, leaves the tree as-is, and returns
`{status: "aborted", ...}` — surface its `tree_state` and stop (the state file stays for
a later resume decision).

**`awaiting_authorization`** — print a one-block summary from the result's fields (merged
tasks, failed tasks, the `code_review` block (verdict, rounds, surviving findings) plus
any `code_review_override`/`code_review_skipped`, gate results, diff stat, and the
`dispatch` block: model counts and published artifacts — `tokens_spent` is usually
`null`, the script has no documented way to read an `agent()` call's own token usage;
omit that line rather than printing an empty one).

**DoD coverage.** The result also carries `dod_coverage`, an array of
`{ text, status: "satisfied" | "unsatisfied" | "unverifiable", evidence }` — one entry
per *functional* Definition-of-Done criterion (the process lines — Gates, Persona panel,
merge conflicts, CI, Discussion comment — are ticked mechanically elsewhere and never
appear in this array) — plus `dod_coverage_status`, one of `"checked" | "not_applicable" |
"failed" | "unknown"`, telling you WHY the array looks the way it does instead of making
you infer it from emptiness-plus-error-presence:
- `"checked"` → the pass ran against a real diff. Non-empty with every entry `satisfied` →
  no callout, this is the genuine all-clear. Empty → the DoD genuinely has no functional
  criteria → print `⚠ no functional acceptance criteria found in the DoD`.
- `"not_applicable"` → an expected, non-alarming outcome (e.g. an artifact-only run, or
  every code branch was already merged by a prior invocation) → print a neutral note, not a
  warning glyph: `ⓘ DoD coverage not checked: <dod_coverage_error>`.
- `"failed"` → the check itself crashed — worth a real warning, since a criterion could be
  sitting unverified: `⚠ DoD coverage check failed: <dod_coverage_error>`.
- `"unknown"` → the state file predates this field (resumed from an older run) — word it
  as its own callout rather than folding it into "failed": `⚠ DoD coverage status unknown
  (resumed from an older run) — verify the DoD manually before authorizing.`

Otherwise (status `"checked"` with unsatisfied/unverifiable entries present) print one line
per criterion, and keep "not met" (a real problem) visually distinct from "not verifiable
from the diff" (may already be true, e.g. manually smoke-tested — the script deliberately
never unticks an `unverifiable` criterion's checkbox, precisely so a prior manual
verification isn't erased on a later resume):
```
[x] satisfied    <criterion text>
[ ] unsatisfied  <criterion text> — <evidence>
[?] unverifiable <criterion text> — <evidence>
```
`[?]` is a deliberate non-claim, not a checkbox reading — this pass never touches an
`unverifiable` criterion's actual GOAL.md box (see above), so printing a hardcoded `[ ]`
here would misreport a box a human may have already ticked by hand. If any criterion is
`unsatisfied`, surface a prominent callout directly above this list — e.g. `⚠ N acceptance
criterion/criteria not met`. If any is `unverifiable`, add a separate, lower-key line —
e.g. `N criterion/criteria not verifiable from the diff alone` — don't fold it into the
"not met" count, they're different claims. Both callouts go **before** the Push & PR
question below, never after — the operator must see them before authorizing the PR, not
after it's already open.

Then the publish decision:

**Push & PR.** This is the right moment: branches are merged, OCR reviewed the merged
diff, gates are green — and nothing has been pushed yet. (The Head Imp reviews the *plan*,
in Phase 2, and never the code; the diff review is OCR's, on the consolidated imp commits
on the run branch.)

**Self-review disclosure.** Print this whenever it applies. It is no longer attached to a
question, so it is the only thing standing between a self-reviewed diff and a published
one. Read it off the result's `code_review` block, not a `head_imp` field — there isn't
one:

- `code_review.rounds > 0` — this session's own fix agents wrote code directly into the
  diff in response to review findings. Say so before asking below.
- `code_review_override` non-null — a review completed with findings still standing and
  they were accepted on the record. Name the rationale.
- `code_review_skipped` non-null — **this diff was never reviewed at all.** Lead with
  that: nothing downstream will catch what a review would have.

**Do not ask — derive it.** `endstate` already answered this in Phase 1 Step 7; asking
again is the interruption that contract exists to remove. Print the summary above so the
operator *sees* what is about to be published, then persist the decision yourself and
re-invoke:

- **there is a diff** (`diff_stat` is non-empty) **and `endstate` is `"pr"`, `"merge"` or
  `"release"`** → persist `PR: yes`.
- **no diff** — a query- or publish-only run, or every branch already merged by a prior
  invocation → persist `PR: no`. There is nothing to open a PR against, and an empty PR
  is worse than none.

`PR: no` remains in the vocabulary for the operator to persist by hand when they want the
branch kept local despite a diff. It is no longer a question the run asks.

**Print before you persist, not after.** The DoD callouts and the self-review disclosure
above are the operator's only chance to catch a bad publish before it happens — they are
now a *report* rather than a gate, which makes printing them faithfully more important,
not less. If any DoD criterion is `unsatisfied`, say so prominently; if
`code_review_skipped` is set, lead with it.

**The persona panel never posts.** Its verdicts return in
`run_complete.findings_inline` for you to read. Personas used to publish real GitHub
reviews under their own App identities, which made posting a separate authorization; that
is gone. The OCR rounds are this run's on-the-record code review, and five bot-authored
approvals of a diff this same session wrote read as independent sign-off without being it.

Pushing and opening is all this decision covers. Whether the run then *merges* is
`endstate` — a run whose endstate is `"pr"` stops at a green PR either way.

Consolidation ends here. The next invocation is Phase 5.

## 🚢 Phase 5 — PR

**PR, Merge, or Release — whichever the operator chose in Phase 1 Step 7.** The phase is
the same work either way; `endstate` decides only how far it goes.

| Step | What happens | Blocks as |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🚀 **1 — Open** | push the branch, open the draft PR | — |
| 🎭 **2 — Panel** | five personas + fix loop, `--personas` only | `unresolved_findings` |
| 🟢 **3 — Green** | review comments, failing checks, base-branch conflicts — bounded rounds | hands off at the cap |
| 🏁 **4 — Close** | merge, then release, as far as `endstate` allows | hands off if refused |
| 🛬 **5 — Land** | final banner, monitor handoff, learnings | returns `final` or `done` |

The PR exists and now has to be driven to a state someone would merge: the persona panel
(when `--personas` was passed) and its fix loop, then review comments, failing checks, and
base-branch conflicts, each repaired and re-pushed for a **bounded** number of rounds.
Where it stops is `endstate`:

| `endstate` | Phase 5 ends when |
| --- | --- |
| `"pr"` | the PR is green. The merge is a human's. |
| `"merge"` | the PR is green **and merged**. |
| `"release"` | merged, then a release cut per the repo's own convention. |

**The bound is not optional.** A PR whose checks never go green, or whose comments keep
arriving, is a loop with no natural end — so it is capped at **three rounds**, the same as
the gate and persona fix loops, and exhausting them is a hand-off, not a failure.

Each round reads the PR's real state (checks, mergeability, unresolved review threads —
waiting for in-flight CI rather than burning a round on a pending result), fixes what is
blocking in that order, commits and pushes, then re-reads. A review comment is addressed by
changing the code when the comment is right; when it isn't, it is left with a stated reason
— never force a change to silence a reviewer, and never resolve a thread you did not
address.

**Merging can be refused, and a refusal is final.** Merging a PR this session authored is
self-approval; the permission classifier blocks it, and there may also be a standing deny
rule on the merge tool itself — the denial text says which. Neither is worked around:
don't retry, don't substitute a raw ref push, and don't ask a subagent to do it instead.
Surface the PR URL and let the operator merge. An `endstate` of `"merge"` that ends in a
green unmerged PR is a complete run with one step left to a human, and should be reported
that way rather than as a failure.

**A release follows the repo's own convention or does not happen.** The release step reads
what the repo already does — existing tags, prior releases, any release workflow, any
documented process — and follows it. If there is no discernible convention, or a workflow
already releases on merge, it does nothing and says why. A guessed tag format is worse than
no release.

The result carries `pr_outcome` — `{rounds, green, merged, released, release_url, refused,
detail}` — plus the resolved `endstate`. Read the run's ending off that rather than
inferring it: `green: false` means the cap was hit, `refused: true` means the merge was
denied, and `merged: false` with `green: true` on a `"merge"` endstate means the PR is
sitting ready for a human.

Both irreversible steps are guarded by their own persisted marker (`merged_at`,
`release_url`), written **independently**. A resumed invocation re-reads the PR state and
re-does neither — but an already-merged PR skips only the merge, so a run that merged and
then died can still cut the release it never reached. Writing the two together would leave
that release unmarked forever and re-cut it on every resume.

**Green means mergeability reported `clean`, not merely "not conflicting".** GitHub
computes it asynchronously and reports unknown while it does; that is the host declining to
answer, not an all-clear, so it is treated as not-green. The status read waits and re-reads
rather than reporting unknown early, and a residual unknown hands off.

Relay works exactly as in Phase 4 — the same `operator_decision` patch, the same fresh
re-invocation. `unresolved_findings` (documented above) is a Phase 5 block: it is the only
blocked reason that arrives after the PR exists.

**`final`** — the run's substantive work is done (PR ready, panel + fix loop finished,
Discussion comment posted) but the state file is **not yet deleted** — the script never
deletes it until the learnings step below completes, specifically so a death between here
and there still resumes gracefully instead of silently losing the `.prs.json` handoff. In
order:

1. Print the final banner by piping the result to the bundled script — via a temp
   file, never shell-quoted inline (the JSON routinely contains `'` and `$`):
   ```bash
   cat > "${CLAUDE_JOB_DIR:-/tmp}/imps-run-complete.json" <<'RESULT_JSON'
   <the final result JSON verbatim>
   RESULT_JSON
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/final-banner.py" < "${CLAUDE_JOB_DIR:-/tmp}/imps-run-complete.json"
   ```
   Then the results from the result's fields:
   ```
     merged:    #6 <label>    (3 files)
     published: #3 Discussion → https://github.com/...
     verdicts:  solution-architect APPROVE · grumpy-engineer APPROVE · ...
     PR:        <url, "ready for review"> | "no PR — branch is local"
     endstate:  merge → merged · release → merged, released <url>
   ```
   Render the `endstate`/`pr_outcome` line as what actually happened, never as what was
   authorized — they differ precisely in the cases the operator most needs to see:
   - `green: false` → `not green after <rounds> round(s) — <detail>; handed over`
   - `refused: true` → `green, merge refused — <detail>; merge it yourself`
   - `merged: true, released: false` on a `"release"` endstate → say the merge landed and
     why no release followed.
   A `"merge"` endstate that ends unmerged is a complete run with one step left to a
   human. Report it that way — not as a failure, and not as a success.
   Every verdict is delivered inline — nothing is posted to GitHub — so no delivery tag
   is needed. `ux-designer SKIPPED` means the surface-detection classifier found no
   browser-renderable surface in the diff; print its one-line reason from `findings`
   rather than rendering it as a bare unqualified word. A SKIPPED persona is an
   unreviewed lens, not an approval.

   Render `run_stats` as a short stats block (Achieved / Decision points / Timing /
   Imps — omit empty sections; `tokens_spent` is typically `null`, per the note above,
   so omit a Tokens line rather than print an empty one). If `findings_inline` is
   populated (`PR: no`)
   or `unresolved` lists blockers/majors that survived 3 rounds, surface them verbatim —
   they are the review record.
2. If `prs_monitor` is non-null, **tell the operator to start the monitor themselves —
   you cannot.** `/imps:prs` sets `disable-model-invocation: true`, so a `Skill` call
   fails; the handoff file exists either way, which is exactly why this must be said
   plainly rather than reported as done. Print:
   `PR #<N> is ready for monitoring, but nothing is watching it yet — run /imps:prs
   yourself to start. It reads the handoff file this run already wrote and needs no
   arguments; until then, comments, CI failures, and conflicts go unattended.`
   Phase 5 Step 3 already drove this PR to green within its round cap; the monitor is for
   what arrives *after* the run ends — a late review, a flaky check on a re-run, base-branch
   drift. Say that, so the offer doesn't read as the run having left the PR unfinished.
   Never claim an active monitor because `.prs.json` was written.
   If `pr` is null, print instead: "Branch is local only and no PR was opened — push and
   open a PR, then run `/imps:prs` yourself to start the monitor."
3. **Learnings gate — its own explicit step, not folded into printing the summary
   above.** This step only exists on a `final` result, and a `final` result only happens
   when `learnings_policy` is `"ask"` — under `"auto"` or `"none"` the script appends (or
   discards) and closes the run out itself, returning `done` directly with no gate. The
   result's own `learnings_policy` field says which applied.

   If `learnings_candidates` is non-empty, present them with **AskUserQuestion**
   (`multiSelect: true`):
   - **question**: `"Any of these worth saving as a learning?"`
   - **header**: `"Learnings"`
   - **options**: one option per candidate (each already phrased as a rule to apply
     next time)

   Persist the outcome into the state file's `operator_decision` field exactly like any
   other decision (same `jq` pattern as above): `learnings: ["<text 1>", "<text 2>"]` —
   or `learnings: none` if nothing was confirmed (or there were no candidates; still
   persist it so the script can close out). **Re-invoke the script fresh once more** —
   this final invocation performs the actual `learnings.md` append (classifying each
   confirmed learning's scope itself, project vs. user — no scope question needed),
   guarded by a `learnings_saved` marker so a crash between the append and the state-file
   delete can't double-append on a subsequent invocation, and only *then* deletes the
   state file (`~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md` — GOAL.md — stays; it's the human-readable
   record).

**`done`** — this last invocation wrote the learnings files and deleted the state file.
Print the closing line using the scope each learning was auto-classified into (from
`learnings_saved`):
```
Learnings saved: "<rule 1>" [project] · "<rule 2>" [user]
```
(or `No learnings saved this run.`). The run is over.

This command does not edit its own body based on the learnings log — `/learn`, run from a
claude-plugins checkout, is what periodically turns recurring `learnings.md` entries into
a proposed, operator-gated edit to this command's body.

---

## Design note — why every Workflow invocation above is fresh, never `resumeFromRunId`

A live spike against the actual `Workflow` tool found two things that rule out
`resumeFromRunId` as this command's resume mechanism: (1) it is documented as
same-session only, so it cannot survive `/clear` or a new session — exactly the case the
**Guard: resume check** above exists to handle; (2) its caching is a
longest-unchanged-*prefix* match, not independent per-call content addressing — changing
one call (e.g. a retried gate) causes every subsequent call to re-execute with a fresh
cache key even when its own inputs are unchanged, which would silently defeat any
duplicate-post guard that assumed the cache would just skip an unaffected downstream call
(PR creation, the learnings append).

So `imps-run.workflow.js` does not use `resumeFromRunId` at all. Every invocation
described above is a fresh `Workflow` call; the script's first step reads the state file
and reconciles against it and git ground truth (worktree branches, GOAL.md checkboxes,
published artifacts) exactly as the old `resume`-mode wrangler did. Idempotency for
side-effecting steps has two distinct sources: **merge** relies on `git merge` of an
already-merged branch being a no-op (no marker needed); **PR creation, the persona panel,
and the learnings append** each check an explicit persisted marker in the state file
(`pr`, `verdicts`, `discussion_comment_url`, `learnings_saved`) before acting — the same
correctness mechanism the old design used, ported in effect rather than replaced by
trusting the platform's cache.

## Model selection reference

Assign by reasoning complexity, not duration or volume:
mechanical (deterministic output, no judgment) → haiku ·
judgment (context, decisions, synthesis) → sonnet ·
deep judgment (large decision space, architectural tradeoffs) → opus.
Always set `model:` explicitly on every `agent()` call.

Model IDs (`claude-*`) vary by session — read the exact identifiers from the session's
model table rather than hardcoding them. The `<haiku|sonnet|opus model id>` placeholders
in the prompts above stand for those current IDs.

---

## Constraints

- Never hand over to the Workflow script without explicit approval of the task list
  (`ExitPlanMode` is that gate).
- Never `git merge --force`, `git reset --hard`, or `git push` without explicit user
  instruction — **exceptions**: (1) after plan approval the Workflow script dispatches
  the imps, rebases the working branch, and merges imp branches autonomously, and it
  pushes + opens the endstate PR only after one of the operator's `Push & open PR ...`
  answers is persisted and a fresh invocation picks it up (pushing fix-loop commits to
  that same PR branch); (2) the `/imps:prs` PR monitor pushes fix commits to the PR
  branch autonomously once activated.
- Never create GitHub PRs without user instruction — the Push & PR gate in Phase 4 is
  that instruction for the endstate PR.
- Personas never post to GitHub. The panel's verdicts return inline in
  `run_complete.findings_inline`, always — the OCR review rounds are this run's
  on-the-record code review, and bot-authored approvals of a diff this same session wrote
  would read as independent sign-off without being it.
- If a task touches a production system, pause and confirm before that task runs.
- The Workflow script owns the run state file and `.prs.json` from handover onward; this
  session's last full state-file write is Phase 2 Step 7. Afterwards it patches exactly
  two fields, both via the documented single-field `jq` pattern: `workflow_script` in
  Phase 3 Step 1, and `operator_decision` in Phase 4. Never a read-modify-write of the
  whole file.
- Worktree isolation is not airtight — after each merge step, don't just trust the
  recorded worktree path; if anything about a merge looks off, check `git status
  --short` and `git log --oneline -3` in the actual main checkout before assuming the
  tree is clean.
- Never bypass commit signing (`--no-gpg-sign` or similar) because the SSH-signing
  agent looks locked or contended — that's usually transient under concurrent swarm
  agents. Retry the commit a few times with a short pause between attempts before
  surfacing it as blocked.
