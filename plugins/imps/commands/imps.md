# /imps:imps — summon the swarm

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Before executing any steps**, output the following intro block so the user knows what's happening:

> 🦇 **imps** — parallel AI swarm for your codebase
>
> Imps decomposes your task into small, dependency-mapped work units and dispatches them to
> parallel AI agents running in isolated git worktrees. Each agent works independently, then
> the results are gated, reviewed by a persona panel, and merged back to a holding branch.
> Think of it as a focused team of specialists rather than one generalist doing everything in sequence.

---

You are a senior engineering orchestrator. Your job is to convert a vague task into a
dependency-mapped plan, get it approved, and hand the entire run to the **Workflow
script** (`scripts/imps-run.workflow.js`) — real control flow, not a subagent, that
dispatches/merges/gates/reviews/finalizes from plan approval to run completion. You hold
decisions; the script holds mechanics.

## Context discipline (applies to every phase)

The main session holds **decisions, not data**. Its context is re-read every turn:

- **Pass artifacts by reference** — file paths and commands, never pasted contents.
- **Delegate noisy work** — recon goes to `scout`/`Explore` subagents; everything from
  dispatch onward lives inside the Workflow script's own execution, which the harness
  tracks separately from this session's transcript. Only compact result summaries and
  operator questions belong in this context.
- If a tool result would be long, redirect to a file and read the tail.

---

## Mode detection

`/imps:imps` has **four modes**, checked in this order:

- **Checklist-file mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a single token ending in `.md`. Resolve the
  file in order: (1) as-is if it's an absolute path or exists relative to cwd, (2)
  `~/.claude/$ARGUMENTS`, (3) `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR/$ARGUMENTS`. If any resolution
  succeeds (`test -f`), treat the file as an audit checklist: **skip all phases below —
  Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/checklist-mode.md` and follow it instead.**
  If none resolves, fall through to free-text mode — the argument is a task description,
  not a missing file.

  Guard: only trigger if `$ARGUMENTS` is a **single** whitespace-free token. A
  multi-token argument that happens to end in `.md` (e.g. `fix the audit md file`) is
  free-text.

- **Issue-driven mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is *entirely* GitHub issue references: every
  whitespace-separated token matches `^#?\d+$` (e.g. `/imps:imps 42 43 51`, `/imps:imps #42`).
  **→ Follow [`commands/issue-mode.md`](./issue-mode.md)** for the
  full scout → rolling-dispatch → holding-branch → gates → persona-panel → handoff
  workflow. Do not continue with the phases below.

- **Discussion-seed mode** — `$ARGUMENTS`, taken as a whole, is a GitHub Discussion
  reference and nothing else: a full URL matching
  `^https?://github\.com/[^/\s]+/[^/\s]+/discussions/\d+([/?#]\S*)?$`
  (also matching a permalink-to-comment or `?sort=` suffix), or the two-token bare form
  matching `^discussion:?\s*#?\d+$` (case-insensitive, resolved against the current
  repo, e.g. `discussion 284`). Discussions live in a different GitHub API/ID space
  than Issues (GraphQL only, no REST) — this is why a discussion reference needs its
  own detection branch instead of falling into issue-driven mode.
  **→ Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/discussion-mode.md` and follow it** — it
  fetches the discussion, seeds it as the free-text task (Phase 0 onward), and defines
  the reply obligation the Workflow script fulfills at finalize.

- **Free-text mode** — `$ARGUMENTS` is a task description (anything that is not purely
  issue numbers or a discussion reference), or empty. This is the original `/imps:imps`
  behaviour. **→ Continue with the phases below.**

Detection order: (1) single `.md` token that resolves to a file → checklist-file mode.
(2) non-empty AND every token matches `^#?\d+$` → issue-driven mode. (3) the whole
argument is a Discussion URL or bare `discussion N` reference → discussion-seed mode.
(4) everything else → free-text mode.

---

## Spooky intro (optional)

If `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py` exists, run it and emit its output verbatim (not in a
code block). It is purely cosmetic — skip silently if absent.

```bash
[ -f "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py" ] && python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-intro.py"
```

## The Head Imp — opus adversarial reviewer

The Head Imp is a reusable one-shot `model: opus` agent that reviews plans and diffs
adversarially. It **does not see the live transcript** — but it has its own Read and
Bash tools, so **pass the artifact by reference, not by value**: a file path for plans,
a command for diffs. The artifact's content never enters your context.

Invoke it like this (swap in the actual reference and role):

```
agent(
  `You are the Head Imp — the sharpest critic in the swarm.
   Your briefs: [READ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/solution-architect.md]
               [READ ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/grumpy-engineer.md]

   ARTIFACT (fetch it yourself):
   <a file path to Read, or a command to run>

   Argue AGAINST this. Find wrong task boundaries, mis-routed models, missing deps,
   correctness bugs, unsafe assumptions, gaps in the DoD. Steelman the case that this
   should NOT ship. Return a list of findings (blocker | major | minor | nit), then a
   one-line VERDICT: APPROVE | CHANGES_REQUESTED.`,
  { model: '<opus model id>', label: '😈' }
)
```

**Phase 2 (plan review):** pass the absolute path of GOAL.md — the Head Imp Reads it.
The **diff review** happens later inside the Workflow script's merge step — you never
invoke it on a diff yourself.

Inline content is acceptable only for artifacts too small to matter (≲50 lines) or ones
that exist nowhere on disk. **Imps may also consult the Head Imp** mid-task when they
hit an ambiguous decision, correctness risk, or a cross-cutting change they're unsure
about — one consultation per blocking question, not a rubber-stamp.

---

## Guard: resume check

**This check fires on every invocation — including when `$ARGUMENTS` is empty.** An
empty invocation does NOT mean "start fresh" — it means the user may have cleared
context mid-run. Always run the guard before Phase 0.

Before anything else:
1. Derive the project slug: `basename "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}"`
2. Check whether `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` exists.

State files from other projects are independent — only the current project's file
matters, and archived files (`<slug>.archived-*.json`, see **New** below) don't count.
If the file exists, read it and check `phase`. Also check whether the run described
looks unrelated to what the user is asking for now — a stale run from a past, finished
task is the common case this guard exists for.

Print a one-block summary either way:
```
  <"Plan ready — not yet dispatched" | "Run in progress — Workflow script was running">
  Task: <task (first 80 chars)>
  Branch: <branch>  ·  <"Dispatched: <dispatched_at>" if set>  ·  Segment: <segment or "—">
  Tasks:  #1 <label>  [<model short> · <type>]
          ...
```

**Case A — `phase: "dispatch_pending"` (plan approved, never handed over):**

- **Resume** — verify `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` matches state `branch` (warn
  and wait for confirmation if not), then jump straight to **Phase 3 — Sync and run the
  Workflow script**. Skip Phases 0/1/2 entirely; the script's own opening step sees
  `phase: "dispatch_pending"` and starts dispatch fresh.
- **New** — start the task the user is asking for now, and leave the existing run
  completely alone: do NOT delete, edit, or touch `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` in
  any way. Instead, move it out of the canonical slot so it stops colliding with the
  new run: `mv ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.archived-$(date +%Y%m%dT%H%M%S).json`.
  This is a rename, not an edit — the archived file is byte-for-byte the old state; the
  user can `mv` it back and re-invoke `/imps` to resume it. Then proceed through
  Phases 0–2 normally for the new task.
- **Abandon** — delete `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` and start fresh.

**Case B — `phase: "wrangler_running"` (kept as the phase-string value for continuity
with existing state files, even though there is no separate wrangler process anymore),
legacy `"dispatched"`, or absent (run was in flight when this context was lost):**

- **Resume** — jump to **Phase 3 — Sync and run the Workflow script**. Its own opening
  step reads the state file, reconciles against ground truth (existing branches, GOAL.md
  checkboxes, heartbeat), re-dispatches only unfinished tasks, and re-enters at the
  recorded segment — exactly what the old `resume`-mode wrangler did. Any imps a dead
  prior invocation had in flight are unreachable; do not try to re-attach to them yourself.
- **New** — same archive-rename procedure as Case A.
- **Abandon** — delete `~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json` and start fresh.

Do not proceed past this check without an answer.

---

## Phase 0 — Brief refinement

Before asking discovery questions, invoke the `prompt-builder` skill to sharpen the task brief (if installed). A well-refined brief reduces decomposition ambiguity and often pre-answers several Phase 1 questions. If `prompt-builder` is not available, refine the brief inline to 1–2 sharp sentences and continue.

**Discussion-seed mode:** skip the "What's the task?" prompt entirely — use
`<DISCUSSION_TASK_SEED>` (built per `references/discussion-mode.md`) as the raw
material below instead of `$ARGUMENTS`.

If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty AND the guard check (above) found no pending state file AND
this is not discussion-seed mode, ask "What's the task?" and wait — collect it here
before invoking prompt-builder.

Use the **Skill tool**:
- `skill`: `prompt-builder:prompt-builder`
- `args`: `MODE: brief-only` as the first line, then a blank line, then the raw task
  description alone (no framing preamble) — `<DISCUSSION_TASK_SEED>` in
  discussion-seed mode, otherwise `$ARGUMENTS` or the collected answer. This sentinel
  opts into prompt-builder's own embedded/brief-only mode (defined in its command
  file), which skips the intro banner, the one-off-vs-reusable reframe, framework
  selection, and the full deliverable template — no steering needed on our side, and
  no diagnosis logic duplicated here. If the installed `prompt-builder` predates this
  mode (ignores the sentinel and runs its full standalone flow), steer once after its
  first response: "Skip model selection, test cases, and save-path guidance — I just
  need 1–2 sharp sentences I can decompose into parallel agents."

Take prompt-builder's `Refined brief: ...` line as `<REFINED_TASK>` directly. If it
instead ran an interactive session (see fallback above), wait for the user to confirm a
refined description before storing it as `<REFINED_TASK>`. Use `<REFINED_TASK>` in
place of `$ARGUMENTS` for all subsequent phases.

---

## Phase 1 — Discovery

Task description: `<REFINED_TASK>`

Ask the following in a **single AskUserQuestion call** (batch all five), **skipping any questions prompt-builder already answered** during Phase 0:

1. Which repo is this work in? (free text) — in discussion-seed mode, default
   to the discussion's own repo and skip asking unless the discussion implies a
   different target repo. Don't ask which branch: Phase 2 Step 6 always cuts a
   fresh dedicated branch off the default branch itself — never the branch the
   operator happens to be on when they run this command.
2. What concrete output artifacts are expected? Be specific — e.g. Bash scripts, GitHub Discussion post, PR, code changes. In discussion-seed mode, a reply comment on the source discussion is posted automatically by the Workflow script at finalize regardless of the answer here — this question is only for artifacts *beyond* that reply.
3. What data sources, APIs, or external access will agents need?
4. How will you know this is done? (acceptance criteria)
5. Any constraints? (e.g. don't touch prod, don't create PRs without review, specific files off-limits)

Wait for all answers before proceeding.

---

## Phase 2 — Plan (native plan mode)

Using `<REFINED_TASK>` and the discovery answers, invoke native plan mode to produce
the authoritative decomposition. Under `opusplan`, plan mode routes to opus — so this
IS the "decompose on opus" requirement, with no duplicate planning pass.

**Step 0:** Load learnings from two sources (both optional). `Read` is a tool call, not
Bash — it does not expand `~`, so resolve `$HOME` yourself and pass the absolute form:
- **User-scoped:** `$HOME/.claude/imps/learnings.md` — stack-agnostic rules that apply across all projects
- **Project-scoped:** `.claude/imps/learnings.md` in the repo root — rules specific to this project (already relative to cwd)

Read the `## Active rules` section from each file that exists. Merge both sets of rules and apply them to model assignment, task boundaries, and dependency detection throughout planning. Project-scoped rules take precedence over user-scoped rules on any conflict.

**Step 1:** Call **`EnterPlanMode`**. You are now the opus planner. Ground the plan in
reality — but **delegate the exploration instead of doing it in this context**: dispatch
`scout` (haiku) subagents for mechanical recon (default branch, gate/lint commands,
file/symbol enumeration, "where is X" lookups) and an `Explore` subagent for broad
sweeps, all in one parallel batch. Read a file directly only when the plan itself must
quote or reason about its contents. Then:

- Break the work into discrete, atomic tasks. Each task has one clearly-stated output
  and is independently completable.
- For each task assign:
  - **Model** — assign by reasoning complexity (see
    [Model selection reference](#model-selection-reference)). Always set `model:` explicitly.
  - **Type** — `code` (file changes, worktree-isolated) · `query` (read-only) ·
    `publish` (GitHub artifacts; use `gh api graphql` for Discussions, not REST)
  - **Depends-on** — prerequisite task IDs, or `—` if independent

**Step 2:** Write **`GOAL.md`** to an absolute path under `~/.claude/imps/runs/` — not
the repo root, so the write never prompts for project-directory access. Derive the slug,
ensure the directory exists, and resolve+echo the absolute path — `Write` is a tool call,
not Bash, and does not expand `~`:
```sh
mkdir -p ~/.claude/imps/runs
SLUG=$(basename "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")
GOAL_PATH="$HOME/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.md"
echo "$GOAL_PATH"
```
Pass the echoed `$GOAL_PATH` value as `Write`'s `file_path` — never the `~/...` form.
Step 6 re-derives the same `SLUG` (and its own absolute `STATE_PATH`) independently (same
one-liner) — shell state doesn't carry across tool calls. Write with this structure:

```markdown
# GOAL — <REFINED_TASK (one line)>

## Definition of Done
- [ ] <acceptance criterion 1>
- [ ] <acceptance criterion 2 — one line each from discovery>
- [ ] Gates green (build · lint · test · type — per GATE_CMDS)
- [ ] Persona panel reviewed; all blocker/major findings addressed
- [ ] No merge conflicts with the default branch

## Task table
 #  Task                                      Model   Type     Depends On
 1  <label>                                   haiku   query    —
 2  ...

## Status
Planned — handing to the Workflow script.
```

Discussion-seed mode: add `- [ ] Outcome comment posted to the source Discussion` to
the Definition of Done — the script fulfills this at finalize; it is not a dispatched
task, and it stays unchecked if the run aborts before finalize (note that in Status
rather than treating it as a bug).
Add `- [ ] CI green on the PR` **only if this run will open a PR** (the endstate PR is
the default for runs that produce code changes; the script adds this line itself when
a PR opens if you omitted it). Omit it for query/publish-only runs, or it stays
permanently unresolvable.

This file is the `/compact`-durable human-readable spine. It lives outside the project
on purpose. The JSON state file (Step 6) is the **authoritative** task table — the
Workflow script dispatches from it, not from GOAL.md. If you hand-edit GOAL.md's task
table after approval, mirror the change into the state file (or re-run planning) or it
will not take effect. After handover, GOAL.md belongs to the script — it ticks the boxes
and keeps Status current.

**Step 3 — Head Imp review (mandatory):**
Before calling `ExitPlanMode`, summon the Head Imp (see the Head Imp section above).
Pass the **absolute path** of `GOAL.md` — the `$GOAL_PATH` value echoed in Step 2, e.g.
`/Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.md`, never the `~/...` form — as the
artifact — the Head Imp Reads it itself. The Head Imp argues AGAINST the plan — wrong
boundaries, mis-routed models, missing deps, gaps in the DoD. Fix what the critique
exposes before proceeding.

**Step 4:** Call **`ExitPlanMode`** — this IS the approval gate. If the user requests
changes, stay in plan mode and revise `GOAL.md`; when approved, proceed.

**Step 5:** Set `poll_interval_seconds: 300` (5-minute default — no user prompt needed).

**Step 6:** Cut the run's dedicated working branch, then write the durable state file
**now** — this is your last write to it; from Phase 3 onward it belongs to the
Workflow script. **Never write the branch you happen to be on into the state file** — that
includes the default branch, and doing so is exactly how a run ends up committing every
task's work straight onto `master`. Always cut a fresh branch off a clean fetch of the
default branch, the same way `commands/issue-mode.md` Phase 1 cuts its holding branch:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.claude/imps/runs
SLUG=$(basename "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")
STATE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.json"
DEFAULT_BRANCH=$(git remote show origin | sed -n '/HEAD branch/s/.*: //p')
RUN_BRANCH="imps/${SLUG}-$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
git fetch origin "$DEFAULT_BRANCH" && git checkout -b "$RUN_BRANCH" "origin/$DEFAULT_BRANCH"
echo "$STATE_PATH"
```

`Write` the JSON below to the echoed `$STATE_PATH` (its `file_path`, not the `~/...`
form — `Write` doesn't expand `~`). Write `$RUN_BRANCH` into `branch` below — never the
discovery answer, never whatever
`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` reported before this step ran. If branch creation
fails for any reason, stop and surface the error rather than falling back to the
current branch.

```json
{
  "schema": 3,
  "task": "<REFINED_TASK>",
  "repo": "<repo from discovery>",
  "branch": "<RUN_BRANCH>",
  "tasks": [
    { "id": 1, "label": "...", "model": "haiku", "type": "query", "deps": [] }
  ],
  "phase": "dispatch_pending",
  "segment": null,
  "dispatched_at": null,
  "poll_interval_seconds": 300,
  "max_dispatch_hours": 6,
  "last_heartbeat": null,
  "tasks_done": [],
  "worktrees": {},
  "artifacts": [],
  "pr": null,
  "verdicts": null,
  "discussion_comment_url": null,
  "source_discussion": null,
  "gate_commands": null,
  "learnings_saved": null,
  "operator_decision": null,
  "last_result": null
}
```

`gate_commands`, `learnings_saved`, `operator_decision`, and `last_result` are new in
schema 3 (the Workflow-script rewrite) — additive only, nothing existing was removed or
repurposed. `gate_commands` persists the once-per-run gate-command discovery result so it
survives across the fresh invocations described in Phase 3/4 (a real state-file field
replaces what used to live only in the wrangler's own session memory for the run's
duration). `operator_decision` carries the pending decision string (the same resume-verb
vocabulary as before) from Phase 4 into the next fresh invocation. `last_result` is the
full result object the script returned last time (verbatim) — a fresh invocation reads
`last_result.status` alongside `operator_decision` to know exactly what to resume into,
rather than re-deriving routing state from `phase`/`segment` alone. `learnings_saved`
guards the learnings-append step exactly like `pr`/`verdicts`/`discussion_comment_url`
guard their own side effects. A legacy schema-2 file (missing these four fields) is
treated as having them all `null` — the script's own dispatch/gate/learnings logic
re-derives
whatever it needs rather than assuming they exist.

Discussion-seed mode: set `source_discussion` to
`{ "owner": "...", "repo": "...", "number": <int>, "id": "<GraphQL node ID>", "url": "<discussion URL>" }`
(fields fetched in `references/discussion-mode.md` step 2). Every other mode leaves it
`null`. Imps are unnamed — each is identified by a themed Nerd Font glyph derived from
its task ID (see the dispatch banner), so the state file carries no `name` field.

Then proceed immediately to Phase 3 — no `/clear` handoff is needed: every Workflow
invocation is fresh by construction (see Phase 4's design note), so dispatch never
inherits this planning window regardless.

---

## Phase 3 — Sync and run the Workflow script

Everything from here to run completion is real control flow inside one Workflow script
(`scripts/imps-run.workflow.js`): git preflight, dispatching the task DAG as staged
`agent()` calls, merging, the Head Imp diff review, gates, the endstate PR, the persona
panel, and finalize. **This command has a hard dependency on the `Workflow` tool — there
is no prose fallback.** If `Workflow` is unavailable in this session, tell the user
plainly (`/imps:imps` requires it) and stop; do not attempt to execute the old
subagent-dispatch protocol inline.

**Step 1 — sync the canonical script.** Workflow scripts only load from a user's own
`~/.claude/workflows/*.js` — a plugin cannot ship one that runs directly. Each run,
re-sync the bundled copy over whatever is there so it always matches the installed
plugin version (a plain overwrite, not a version/hash check). **The `Workflow` tool call
below is not Bash — it does not expand `~`,** so resolve and echo the absolute paths here
first, and pass those literal echoed values (never the `~/...` form) into Step 2:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/workflows
cp "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/imps-run.workflow.js" ~/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js
SLUG=$(basename "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}")
WORKFLOW_DEST="$HOME/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js"
STATE_PATH="$HOME/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.json"
GOAL_PATH="$HOME/.claude/imps/runs/${SLUG}.md"
echo "$WORKFLOW_DEST"; echo "$STATE_PATH"; echo "$GOAL_PATH"
```

**Step 2 — invoke it.** Every invocation is a **fresh** `Workflow` call — never
`resumeFromRunId` (see the design note at the end of this file for why). The script's own
first step reads the state file and decides what's already done; there is nothing for the
harness's own resume mechanism to add, and relying on it would risk silently re-triggering
side effects the script itself must guard against instead.

```
Workflow({
  scriptPath: "<the echoed $WORKFLOW_DEST value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/workflows/imps-run.js>",
  args: {
    pluginRoot: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}",
    stateFilePath: "<the echoed $STATE_PATH value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json>",
    goalFilePath: "<the echoed $GOAL_PATH value, e.g. /Users/you/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md>",
    personaPostingProtocolPath: "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/persona-posting.md",
    personaBriefPaths: {
      "solution-architect": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/solution-architect.md",
      "grumpy-engineer": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/grumpy-engineer.md",
      "sre": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/sre.md",
      "business-analyst": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/business-analyst.md",
      "ux-designer": "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/personas/ux-designer.md"
    }
  }
})
```

**Step 3 — print the dispatch banner and stop; you'll be notified.** `Workflow` runs in
the background — this turn ends here, not after the run finishes.

```bash
SLUG=$(basename "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR:-$(pwd)}") ; python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/dispatch-banner.py" "$SLUG"
```

Progress between results is visible in the state file — the script heartbeats
`last_heartbeat` and `tasks_done` as tasks complete, same fields as before, for the
banner's `progress:` hint to read. Whether a single hung (non-erroring) `agent()` call has
a platform-level timeout is **not verified** — this is a residual, carried-over risk, not
one this rewrite claims to have solved (today's design also had no automated hang
detector for this case, only a human-visible heartbeat staleness signal).

---

## Phase 4 — Result relay loop

Each phase of the script ends in exactly one returned `status`, arriving as a
`<task-notification>` when the background `Workflow` run reaches that point. There is no
`SendMessage`/`agentId` to resume — an operator decision is **persisted into the state
file**, then the script is **re-invoked fresh** (Phase 3 Steps 1–3 again, verbatim). The
script's own opening step reads the state file and skips whatever it says is already
done; this is how "resume" works throughout, deliberately not via `resumeFromRunId` (see
the design note at the end of this file).

To persist a decision, patch the state file's `operator_decision` field before
re-invoking (a single preapprovable command, not a hand-rolled multi-line edit):

```bash
jq --arg d '<the decision string, same vocabulary as today — see below>' \
  '.operator_decision = $d' ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json > "$TMPDIR/imps-state.json" \
  && mv "$TMPDIR/imps-state.json" ~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.json
```

The decision vocabulary is almost unchanged from before: `resolved, continue` ·
`retry <gate>: <guidance>` · `skip <gate>` · `reconciled, continue` ·
`retry tasks #N,#M: <guidance>` · `skip tasks #N,#M` · `integrate partial` ·
`PR: yes` · `PR: yes, no-post` · `PR: no` · `learnings: <json|none>` · `abort` — the
delivery mechanism changed (from a `SendMessage` to a spawned subagent, to a state-file
field read by a fresh script invocation), and one verb is dropped: `wait <hours>` existed
to extend `max_dispatch_hours`'s manual poll-loop timeout, which no longer exists (see
the design note) — there is no `dispatch_timeout` blocked reason for it to resume from
either. `integrate partial` is still supported: it confirms every currently-unresolved
task failure as an accepted omission (the same effect as naming them all in
`skip tasks`), so re-dispatch doesn't re-block on the same failures.

**If a result never arrives** (session lost, `/clear`, or the run legitimately needs
picking up later): do nothing special here — the **Guard: resume check** at the top of
this command already handles it. Re-running `/imps:imps` reads the state file's `phase`
and `segment`, and Phase 3 re-syncs and re-invokes the script fresh; its own opening step
reconciles against the state file and git ground truth exactly as the old `resume`-mode
wrangler did (worktree branches, GOAL.md checkboxes, published artifacts) — see the
design note for what the script must implement to preserve this.

**`blocked` results** — surface the problem, agree the next step with the user, persist
the decision, re-invoke:
- `dispatch_failed` — preflight rebase conflict or imp-dispatch error. The user fixes
  the tree (or decides); persist `resolved, continue` or `abort`.
- `imps_failed` — failed tasks block the DoD. Ask the user (retry with guidance / skip
  those tasks / integrate without any of the unresolved ones / abort) and persist
  `retry tasks #N: ...`, `skip tasks #N`, `integrate partial`, or `abort`.
- `merge_conflict` — the conflict is live in the shared working tree. List the branch +
  files; let the user resolve (or resolve trivial conflicts yourself), then persist
  `resolved, continue`.
- `gate_red` — surface the gate name + log tail; agree retry guidance, skip, or abort.
- `branch_mismatch` — reconcile branch state with the user, then persist
  `reconciled, continue`.

If the user chooses abort at any gate, persist `abort` and re-invoke. The script posts
any Discussion abort notice itself before returning, leaves the tree as-is, and returns
`{status: "aborted", ...}` — surface its `tree_state` and stop (the state file stays for
a later resume decision).

**`awaiting_authorization`** — print a one-block summary from the result's fields (merged
tasks, failed tasks, Head Imp verdict + amendments, gate results, diff stat, and the
`dispatch` block: model counts and published artifacts — `tokens_spent` is usually
`null`, the script has no documented way to read an `agent()` call's own token usage;
omit that line rather than printing an empty one). Then the operator gate:

**Push & PR decision.** The persona panel posts its findings as comments on a PR
thread, so the PR must exist first. This is the correct moment: branches are merged,
the Head Imp reviewed the diff, gates are green — and nothing has been pushed yet.

**Self-review disclosure.** If the `awaiting_authorization` result's `head_imp.amendments`
is non-zero, this session wrote code directly into the diff during the Head Imp fix-loop —
say so before asking below. Persona posting through each's dedicated GitHub App identity
(`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/persona-posting.md`) is attribution/audit-trail
only; it is not an independent review of content this same session authored, and
pushing/PR-creation is a separate authorization from letting personas post live GitHub
reviews — one does not imply the other.

Ask with **AskUserQuestion**:
- **question**: `"Push this branch and open the endstate PR for review?"`
- **header**: `"Push & PR?"`
- **options**:
  1. `Push & open PR, personas post live reviews` — the script pushes the branch,
     opens a draft PR (flipped to ready at finalize), and personas post real GitHub
     reviews on that thread under their own identities. Activates the handoff for the
     `/imps:prs` monitor.
  2. `Push & open PR, findings only (no persona posts)` — same push/PR as above, but no
     persona calls `persona-post.sh`; every verdict returns in
     `run_complete.findings_inline` for you to read or post yourself. Use this when the
     disclosure above applies and you'd rather a human than a bot identity be the first
     to put a verdict on the record.
  3. `Not yet` — no push, no PR. The persona panel returns its findings in
     `run_complete.findings_inline`; the branch stays local and no PR monitor starts.

Opening the endstate PR is the default for free-text runs that produced code changes —
only `Not yet` skips it. Option 2 exists specifically for the self-review case named in
the disclosure above — offer it deliberately, not as a throwaway third choice. Persist
exactly `PR: yes`, `PR: yes, no-post`, or `PR: no` and re-invoke. The script then runs the
PR + persona panel + fix loop + finalize steps in the same invocation.

**`final`** — the run's substantive work is done (PR ready, panel + fix loop finished,
Discussion comment posted) but the state file is **not yet deleted** — the script never
deletes it until the learnings step below completes, specifically so a death between here
and there still resumes gracefully instead of silently losing the `.prs.json` handoff. In
order:

1. Print the final banner by piping the result to the bundled script — via a temp
   file, never shell-quoted inline (the JSON routinely contains `'` and `$`):
   ```bash
   cat > "${CLAUDE_JOB_DIR:-/tmp}/imps-run-complete.json" <<'RESULT_JSON'
   <the final result JSON verbatim>
   RESULT_JSON
   python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/final-banner.py" < "${CLAUDE_JOB_DIR:-/tmp}/imps-run-complete.json"
   ```
   Then the results from the result's fields:
   ```
     merged:    #6 <label>    (3 files)
     published: #3 Discussion → https://github.com/...
     verdicts:  solution-architect APPROVE · grumpy-engineer APPROVE · ...
     PR:        <url, "ready for review"> | "no PR — branch is local"
   ```
   Render `run_stats` as a short stats block (Achieved / Decision points / Timing /
   Imps — omit empty sections; `tokens_spent` is typically `null`, per the note above,
   so omit a Tokens line rather than print an empty one). If `findings_inline` is
   populated (`PR: no`)
   or `unresolved` lists blockers/majors that survived 3 rounds, surface them verbatim —
   they are the review record.
2. If `prs_monitor` is non-null: invoke the `/imps:prs` skill (no args — it reads the
   `.prs.json` the script already wrote), then print:
   `PR monitor active — watching PR #<N>. I'll address comments, fix CI failures, and
   resolve merge conflicts automatically.`
   If `pr` is null, print instead: "Branch is local only and no PR was opened — push
   and open a PR, then invoke `/imps:prs` to activate the monitor."
3. **Learnings gate — its own explicit step, not folded into printing the summary
   above.** If `learnings_candidates` is non-empty, present them with **AskUserQuestion**
   (`multiSelect: true`):
   - **question**: `"Any of these worth saving as a learning?"`
   - **header**: `"Learnings"`
   - **options**: one option per candidate (each already phrased as a rule to apply
     next time)

   Persist the outcome into the state file's `operator_decision` field exactly like any
   other decision (same `jq` pattern as above): `learnings: ["<text 1>", "<text 2>"]` —
   or `learnings: none` if nothing was confirmed (or there were no candidates; still
   persist it so the script can close out). **Re-invoke the script fresh once more** —
   this final invocation performs the actual `learnings.md` append (classifying each
   confirmed learning's scope itself, project vs. user — no scope question needed),
   guarded by a `learnings_saved` marker so a crash between the append and the state-file
   delete can't double-append on a subsequent invocation, and only *then* deletes the
   state file (`~/.claude/imps/runs/<slug>.md` — GOAL.md — stays; it's the human-readable
   record).

**`done`** — this last invocation wrote the learnings files and deleted the state file.
Print the closing line using the scope each learning was auto-classified into (from
`learnings_saved`):
```
Learnings saved: "<rule 1>" [project] · "<rule 2>" [user]
```
(or `No learnings saved this run.`). The run is over.

## Design note — why every Workflow invocation above is fresh, never `resumeFromRunId`

A live spike against the actual `Workflow` tool found two things that rule out
`resumeFromRunId` as this command's resume mechanism: (1) it is documented as
same-session only, so it cannot survive `/clear` or a new session — exactly the case the
**Guard: resume check** above exists to handle; (2) its caching is a
longest-unchanged-*prefix* match, not independent per-call content addressing — changing
one call (e.g. a retried gate) causes every subsequent call to re-execute with a fresh
cache key even when its own inputs are unchanged, which would silently defeat any
duplicate-post guard that assumed the cache would just skip an unaffected downstream call
(persona posting, PR creation, the learnings append).

So `imps-run.workflow.js` does not use `resumeFromRunId` at all. Every invocation
described above is a fresh `Workflow` call; the script's first step reads the state file
and reconciles against it and git ground truth (worktree branches, GOAL.md checkboxes,
published artifacts) exactly as the old `resume`-mode wrangler did. Idempotency for
side-effecting steps has two distinct sources: **merge** relies on `git merge` of an
already-merged branch being a no-op (no marker needed); **PR creation, persona posting,
and the learnings append** each check an explicit persisted marker in the state file
(`pr`, `verdicts`, `discussion_comment_url`, `learnings_saved`) before acting — the same
correctness mechanism the old design used, ported in effect rather than replaced by
trusting the platform's cache.

## Model selection reference

Assign by reasoning complexity, not duration or volume:
mechanical (deterministic output, no judgment) → haiku ·
judgment (context, decisions, synthesis) → sonnet ·
deep judgment (large decision space, architectural tradeoffs) → opus.
Always set `model:` explicitly on every `agent()` call.

Model IDs (`claude-*`) vary by session — read the exact identifiers from the session's
model table rather than hardcoding them. The `<haiku|sonnet|opus model id>` placeholders
in the prompts above stand for those current IDs.

## Constraints

- Never hand over to the Workflow script without explicit approval of the task list
  (`ExitPlanMode` is that gate).
- Never `git merge --force`, `git reset --hard`, or `git push` without explicit user
  instruction — **exceptions**: (1) after plan approval the Workflow script dispatches
  the imps, rebases the working branch, and merges imp branches autonomously, and it
  pushes + opens the endstate PR only after one of the operator's `Push & open PR ...`
  answers is persisted and a fresh invocation picks it up (pushing fix-loop commits to
  that same PR branch); (2) the `/imps:prs` PR monitor pushes fix commits to the PR
  branch autonomously once activated.
- Never create GitHub PRs without user instruction — the Push & PR gate in Phase 4 is
  that instruction for the endstate PR.
- Persona live-posting is a separate authorization from push/PR creation, not implied by
  it — only the `Push & open PR, personas post live reviews` answer (persisted as
  `PR: yes`) authorizes personas to post real GitHub reviews; `PR: yes, no-post` and
  `PR: no` both forbid it.
- If a task touches a production system, pause and confirm before that task runs.
- The Workflow script owns the run state file and `.prs.json` from handover onward; this
  session's last direct state-file write is Phase 2 Step 6 (later writes are the
  `operator_decision` patches in Phase 4, applied via `jq` as documented there).
