# run-code-review.sh — the /imps:imps code-review gate entrypoint.
#
# Tries a Codex adversarial review first (scripts/run-codex-review.sh); falls back to
# OpenCodeReview (scripts/run-ocr.sh) whenever Codex is unavailable, times out, or
# produces no usable verdict. A completed Codex review — approve or needs-attention — is
# authoritative and is never second-guessed by also running OCR: Codex is a genuinely
# different reviewer, not a pre-filter, and running both on a "needs-attention" verdict
# would just be shopping for a clean pass. See references/codex-review.md and
# references/ocr-review.md for the two engines' own contracts and failure modes.
#
# Same CLI surface and output contract as run-ocr.sh, so this is a drop-in replacement
# for it as the /imps:imps gate: {"status":"ok|blocked","verdict":...,"findings":[...],
# "model":...,"provider":...,"session_id":...,"duration_ms":...,"cost_usd":...,"reason":...}
#
# --check must still pass on OCR alone: OCR is the mandatory backstop, Codex is optional.
# A missing Codex install is normal and never fails --check.
