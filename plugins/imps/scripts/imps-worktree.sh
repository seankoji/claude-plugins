# imps-worktree.sh — manage the git worktrees that make concurrent /imps:imps runs safe.
#
#   imps-worktree.sh new [name]     create a run worktree (name defaults to a random slug)
#   imps-worktree.sh list           list run worktrees and whether each has a live run
#   imps-worktree.sh remove <name>  remove a run worktree (refuses if a run is live)

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why this exists
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every `/imps:imps` orchestration step — cutting the run branch, merging imp branches,
# running gates, syncing the default branch, pushing the PR, fix rounds — operates on the
# session's own working tree. Two runs sharing one working tree therefore fight over one
# HEAD: run A's `git checkout -b` lands run B's merges on the wrong branch.
#
# The fix is not to thread a path through the orchestration prompts (which would make
# correctness depend on every agent honouring a `cd`, and turn a loud collision into
# silent cross-run corruption). It is to give each run its own working tree and start its
# session there, so cwd is right by construction and no prompt has to be trusted.
#
# Per-run identity follows automatically: `imps-paths.sh` derives the slug from
# `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`, so each worktree already gets its own state file,
# GOAL.md and `.prs.json`.

  1. Install this repo's dependencies in the new worktree — a fresh worktree has none,
     and /imps:imps runs its gates (lint/test/build) in the session's own tree:
         cd "$dest" && <your install command, e.g. npm ci>
  2. Start a Claude Code session with that worktree as its cwd, and run /imps:imps there.

The run's state file, GOAL.md and .prs.json are keyed to this worktree's slug
($(slug_for "$dest" 2>/dev/null || echo '<derived on first run>')), so it will not
collide with any other run against this repo.
