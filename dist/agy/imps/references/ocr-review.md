# OCR fallback review

`/imps` calls `scripts/run-code-review.sh`: a bounded isolated Codex attempt followed by OCR only when no usable Codex verdict exists. An adverse verdict remains authoritative. The runtime applies the revision/acceptance rules in [workflow-contract.md](workflow-contract.md). Reviewer lineage is recorded, not treated as proof of independence.

## Setup

Nothing, if the `litellm` provider is already configured in `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` — `run-ocr.sh` reads `options.baseURL` and `options.apiKey` straight out of it rather than asking for a second copy of the same endpoint and key. It normalises the base URL to the OpenAI-compatible `/v1` form, because OpenCode stores the proxy root and appends that path itself while OCR expects it present.

The `ocr` CLI installs itself on first use, pinned. The preflight gates on the *installed version*, not on `ocr` merely being present: a presence-only check leaves a stale global install in place forever, and `command -v` alone can find a launcher whose platform binary never finished downloading — that dies at the review call with exit 127, after every setup step has already run.

Override any of it:

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `IMPS_OCR_MODEL` | `deepseek-v4-flash` | Model id sent to the endpoint |
| `IMPS_OCR_URL` | from `opencode.json` | OpenAI-compatible base URL |
| `IMPS_OCR_TOKEN` | from `opencode.json` | Credential |
| `IMPS_OCR_VERSION` | `1.11.3` | Pinned `ocr` release |
| `IMPS_OCR_CONCURRENCY` | `4` | Files reviewed in parallel |
| `IMPS_OCR_TIMEOUT` | `900` | Wall-clock cap on the whole review |
| `IMPS_OCR_LLM_TIMEOUT` | `180` | Per-request cap inside OCR |
| `IMPS_OCR_RULE` | `references/ocr-review-rule.json` | Review rules |

`--check` runs the preflight alone: `jq`, `git`, `perl`, the rule file, resolvable credentials, the pinned `ocr` version, and JSON output support.

## Isolation

OCR reviews `--from <merge-base> --to <head>` against the real repository. Unlike the OpenCode agent it has no tool surface that can mutate anything, so this does not build the deny-everything snapshot the previous implementation needed. Two protections are kept:

- `HOME` is redirected to a temp directory for the run, so `ocr config set` cannot write to the real one.
- HEAD and `git status --porcelain` are captured before and compared after. A mismatch is `source_mutated` and blocks. It is two git calls, and it is the check that would catch an engine that started writing.

## The contract

The helper emits one final JSON line on stdout — status, verdict, findings, model, provider, session ID, duration, cost when available, and a fixed failure reason. Everything else goes to stderr.

OCR emits `{"comments":[{path, start_line, end_line, body}], …}` and **has no severity field**. The imps contract requires one, so `references/ocr-review-rule.json` instructs the reviewer to prefix every comment with `[blocker]`, `[major]`, `[minor]` or `[nit]`, and `run-ocr.sh` parses that prefix off the body.

**An untagged comment is treated as `major`.** That is deliberate: a model that ignores the instruction blocks the run rather than silently passing it, which is the same fail-closed rule the rest of this gate follows. If untagged comments become common, fix the rule file — do not soften the fallback.

The verdict is derived, since OCR has none of its own: any `blocker` or `major` yields `CHANGES_REQUESTED`, otherwise `APPROVE`. This matches the contract's own rule that `APPROVE` may not carry either severity.

**A single pass is not exhaustive or deterministic on a large diff.** Different findings can
surface on different re-reviews of the identical diff — a finding that doesn't recur on a
retry was not necessarily addressed, it may simply not have been sampled that time, and a
clean pass is evidence of no findings in whatever was sampled, not of full coverage. Fix real
issues as they surface rather than treating any single pass (clean or not) as complete.

## Failures

`CHANGES_REQUESTED` findings are fixed by Claude, gates rerun, and a fresh OCR run reviews the new diff. After three repair rounds the run blocks with `code_review_red`; an operator may record `override code review: <rationale>` only then.

`provider_config_missing` means neither the environment nor `opencode.json` yielded an endpoint and credential. `ocr_version_mismatch` means the install did not land on the pin. Timeouts and malformed verdicts are blocking failures, not soft warnings — there is no OpenRouter fallback, no Claude diff review, and no Head Imp code-review supplement.

## Why OCR

The previous engine was the OpenCode agent, issuing one completion covering the entire diff. That reliably timed out against a self-hosted OpenAI-compatible endpoint once a diff got large: a 2,752-line diff killed it twice, at 99s and at 120s (exit 143), producing no verdict either time. A review that cannot return is a gate that cannot pass — and the failure got worse exactly as changes got bigger, which is backwards.

OCR is a purpose-built diff reviewer. It chunks per file and fans out with `--concurrency`, so review cost scales with the widest file rather than with the whole changeset, and a slow endpoint degrades throughput instead of hitting a wall.

The names remain an ongoing hazard: the OpenCode agent and the `open-code-review` package are unrelated projects, and "opencode" appears in both. Prefer "OCR" for the review tool and "the OpenCode agent" for the other, and keep filenames unambiguous.
